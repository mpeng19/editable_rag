There are no significant differences in the making of Douhua, doufunao and tofu other than the use of solidifier and the force used for pressing. Doufunao requires minimal solidifier and pressing, while douhua used less solidifier than tofu and is loosely pressed in comparison.\nDouhua often served as an important ingredient in Sichuanese cuisine. It can be served with meat in a stew, like fish (Chinese: 豆花鱼) or beef (Chinese: 豆花牛肉). Additionally, it can be used to thicken hot pot, or paired individually with a dip.: 123.18  There is a Sichuanese speciality dish called Jidouhua (Chinese: 鸡豆花, 'chicken douhua'), which uses chicken to imitate the texture of douhua.",
    "\"Hay que caminar\" soñando": "\"Hay que caminar\" soñando (Spanish: \"We must walk\" dreaming) is the last composition by avant-garde composer Luigi Nono, composed one year before passing away at the age of 66. Scored for two violins, it was premiered during Nono's lifetime.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCommissioned by the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne, \"Hay que caminar\" was born out of expanded material from Nono's previous work, La lontananza nostalgica utopica futura, and was the fourth and last piece to bear a title related to the \"Caminantes\", after Caminantes... Ayacucho, No hay caminos, hay que caminar... Andrei Tarkovsky, and La lontananza. This is in reference to a quote by Spanish author Antonio Machado (\"Caminante, no hay caminos, hay que caminar\" — Traveller, there are no ways, but we must go), which he saw in Toledo, and faintly represents his political commitment and his desire for social justice. The original title also bears an additional inscription: \"KOE 20 A\", which refers to the house the piece was composed in — Königstraße 20a, in Berlin. The piece was finished on March 2, 1989, and was dedicated \"A Tatiana e Gidon\" (To Tatiana [Grindenko] and Gidon [Kremer]). The piece was premiered at the Sala Grande del Conservatorio Giuseppe Verdi, in Milan, on October 14, 1989, by violinists Irvine Arditti and David Alberman, and was published later that year by Casa Ricordi.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\"Hay que caminar\" is scored for two violins and takes around 25 minutes to perform.",

Spin's Stephen Deusner concluded that \"rather than a throwback or a neo-neo-traditionalist, he just sounds like a guy singing his sad, sad songs to the huddled masses\".\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that while Crockett's \"approach\" may be similar to its predecessor The Man from Waco (2022), the album \"feels considerably different thanks to the troubadour swapping country for soul as the album's connective tissue\". Ben Salmon, reviewing the album for Paste, found that the album \"sounds remarkably warm and alive and real; it feels like you can step on the bass lines, put the twinkling piano notes in your pocket or reach out and touch the pedal steel guitar parts\". Glide Magazine's Jim Hynes stated that the musicians recording live to tape \"feels like a live performance\" and Crockett \"remains squarely in the front row of today's best writers\".",

    "10-Hydroxyketotifen": "10-Hydroxyketotifen (WR621365) is a biologically inactive metabolite of ketotifen.  Despite the mainstream scientific consensus that 10-hydroxyketotifen is a biologically inactive compound, its pharmacological properties are not very well studied outside the context of ketotifen, therefore, 10-hydroxyketotifen may still posses biological activity similarly to norketotifen, another metabolite of ketotifen.\n\n\n== Metabolic role ==\n\nKetotifen is an antihistamine medication which metabolizes to several compounds, including 10-hydroxyketotifen. Ketotifen, like other antihistamines, is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, especially CYP3A4 in the liver. The CYP enzymes are responsible for the oxidation and demethylation of ketotifen, producing the major metabolites norketotifen and 10-hydroxyketotifen. Norketotifen is pharmacologically active and has a similar potency as ketotifen, while 10-hydroxyketotifen is inactive. The metabolites are then conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate and excreted in the urine and feces.\nThe definition and measurement of biological activity of drugs can be complex: biological activity is often defined in terms of the ability of a molecule to effect a change in a biological process, which can be quantified and measured in various ways; as such, even if 10-hydroxyketotifen is currently deemed inactive, it is possible that under certain conditions or within specific biological assays, some level of activity might be observed.",

It is housed in the building upon which the Macedonian Partisans, of the Prilep detachment, made their first attack as part of the National Liberation War of Macedonia. The building was in use at this time as a Bulgarian police station.\nBuilt in the early 20th century, the building is located in the Prilep city center and is listed as an Object of Cultural Heritage by the Ministry of Culture. While its original purpose is unknown, it served as a high school and a wine cellar prior to World War II. Its use as a museum dedicated to the fight against fascism started on 1 May 1952 during the Yugoslav era, with its first major expansion occurring in 1961. The museum contains various documents, sketches, maps, weapons and other artefacts on the subject.\nThe building was renovated from April to October 2011 with funds from the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Macedonia and Prilep Municipality, with a re-opening event occurring on and around 11 October to commemorate 70 years since the uprising.

    "11th (Service) Battalion, Suffolk Regiment (Cambridgeshire)": "The 11th (Service) Battalion, Suffolk Regiment (Cambridgeshire) was a 'Pals battalion' raised in Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely for 'Kitchener's Army' in World War I. It served on the Western Front from January 1916 until the Armistice, seeing action at the Somme – where it was virtually destroyed on the first day – Arras, Ypres, against the German spring offensive when it defended Henin Hill, in the Battle of the Lys and the final Battle of the Selle.\n\n\n== Recruitment ==\n\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. The K2, K3 and K4 battalions, brigades and divisions followed soon afterwards. But the flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the Army to absorb them. When the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised on 10 December 1914 many of its units had already been raised by local initiative rather than at regimental depots, often from men from particular localities or backgrounds who wished to serve together: these were known as 'Pals battalions'. In parallel, the county Territorial Associations, which administered the prewar voluntary Territorial Force (TF), had also been dealing with a surge in recruitment. Unusually, the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely TF Association was asked by the War Office (WO) to deal with the excess 'K' recruits from their county, who could not be handled by the nearest Regular regimental deport (the Suffolk Regiment at Bury St Edmunds). This was in addition to recruiting and equipping an extra battalion of the county's TF regiment (the Cambridgeshire Regiment).",

A primary election to elect the new general coodinator of the party was held from 26 May to 29 May 2016. This was the first leadership election in IU's history in which all the party members were allowed to vote.\nThe congress was held just before the 2016 Spanish general election, which IU contested in a coalition with Podemos. This decision produced an internal rift, leaving the party divided into three factions. The first one was composed of incumbent General Coordinator Cayo Lara and members of the old guard who were radically against any alliance with Podemos. The second was led by IU's spokesman in the Congress of Deputies Alberto Garzón—who was contesting the general election for Unidos Podemos—and received the support of the majority sector of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and of most of the IU federations. The third sector was made up of members of Open Left (IzAb), the party led by former general coordinator Gaspar Llamazares, a longtime critic of Lara's leadership.\nThe leadership election saw a generational renovation with Garzón becoming the new general coordinator in a landslide as he received 74.7% of the members vote. Meanwhile, the candidacy of Paloma López Bermejo—supported by Lara and the old guard—received 20.8% of the vote and the candidate of IzAb, Tasio Oliver, finished last with just 4.6% of support.",

Presented at a press conference on 17 January, 2024, the report highlighted the election's one-sided nature and lack of competitiveness, neither free nor inclusive, posing a threat to the country's democracy. The Bangladesh Election Commission played a catalytic role in advancing the one-sided 'agenda,' with other state institutions, including law enforcement agencies and the administration, supporting the same 'agenda.' While independent candidates from the government party were assigned roles to foster competitiveness, most constituencies lacked true competition, with 241 out of 300 having no contests. A total of 41.8 percent polling, including 15.43 percent polling in the last hour of the election, sparked controversy. Despite technical success, the report suggests enduring questions about political integrity, democratic values, and ethical standards. The election failed to meet the prerequisites for fairness, participation, impartiality, and equal competition. The results indicate consolidated institutional dominance and a continued path of unchecked power and responsibility-free implementation in the political and governance system.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKazi Habibul Awal, the Chief Election Commissioner of Bangladesh, acknowledges the lack of inclusivity in the election but distances himself from advancing the government's agenda.

    "1559–1562 French political crisis": "The 1559–1562 French political crisis was induced by the death of the king Henri II in July 1559. With his death, the throne fell to François II who though not a minor, lacked the ability to command authority due to his young age. Actual power fell to two of Henri II's favourites, the duc de Guise (duke of Guise) and cardinal de Lorraine who quickly moved to assert a monopoly of their authority over the administration of the kingdom. Royal patronage would flow to them and their clients, with those of their rival, Constable Montmorency quickly starved of royal favour. Having been left with ruinous debts by Henri, they undertook a campaign of aggressive austerity which further alienated many grandees and soldiers who were not shielded from its effects (as the clients of the Lorraine brothers were). They also continued the persecution of Protestantism that had transpired under Henri II, though with the young François on the throne the Protestants felt emboldened to resist.\nTo this end aggrieved Protestants and political opponents of the Lorraine brothers administration formulated a conspiracy to assume control of the king and end the Lorraine administration. This manifested in an attempted conspiracy at Amboise in March 1560. Guise and Lorraine were able to suppress the conspiracy, crushing it brutally. They suspected that the Protestant prince du sang (prince of the blood) prince de Condé was the architect of the conspiracy, and Condé thus departed from court shortly after the conspiracy under a cloud of suspicion.",
    "155 Mercer Street": "155 Mercer Street is a former firemen's hall, now commercial building, located on Mercer Street, in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. Built in 1855, the building featured an ornate façade designed by Field & Correja which was largely removed over a series of changes between 1893 and the mid-1970s. The last fire company left the building in 1974.\nThe Dia Art Foundation acquired the building, opening the Masjid al-Farah Sufi mosque within it in 1980. They also installed several Dan Flavin artworks in 1982. The mosque closed in 1985 with Dia turning the building into rehearsal and performance space largely for contemporary dance the same year. In 1996, while dealing with financial troubles, Dia sold the building to the Joyce Theatre Foundation who continued to run it as a rehearsal and performance space for contemporary dance. Joyce sold the building in 2012 after which it was renovated to echo its original design. 155 Mercer has since been used as a commercial property with a prominent storefront.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Firemen's hall ===\n\nThis building was originally built in 1855 by the city as the volunteers' headquarters for two fire companies on the site of a previous fireman's hall.",

Making up nearly 90% of the African-American population within Syracuse. Consisting of not only dozens of black owned businesses and homes, but Jewish neighborhoods as well. The 15th ward became a refuge for many African-Americans before it was demolished during the urban renewal projects of the 1950s and 1960s.

The Rif and the Betic Cordillera were formed during the Cenozoic, initially as a result of convergence between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The collisional structure was modified during the Miocene by a combination of westward migration of the mountain belt and extension that resulted in formation of the Alboran Sea The extension may be a result of back-arc basin formation related to subduction during the Miocene. Although it remains unclear whether there is still active subduction, the convergence continues at a rate of 4 mm per year in a NW–SE direction. The most external part of the Rif is formed of a series of thrust faults and related folds, referred to as the Prerif.",

    "1770s Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic": "The first known smallpox epidemic to strike the native peoples of the coastal and interior Pacific Northwest arrived in the early 1770s, devastating large swathes of the population and causing significant demographic collapse – both from the disease itself and corresponding malnutrition from the deaths of hunters within tribes. Poorly attested due to a lack of consistent European presence during the period, it most likely originated from Bruno de Heceta and Bodega y Quadra's 1775 expedition to the Northwest Coast, spreading as far inland as the Bitterroot Salish territories in western Montana and as far north as the Tlingit at Sitka. Widespread pockmarks and scars among older native populations were recorded by European explorers for several decades afterwards, including Lewis and Clark and George Vancouver. Several additional smallpox epidemics would occur in the region over the following decades. \n\n\n== Background ==\nSmallpox is a highly infectious disease spread primarily through droplet infection, as well as direct contact with infected individuals or corpses. Typically, the disease incubates asymptomatically for a period of two weeks before becoming infectious for another two-week period. The more deadly and historically prominent variant, Variola major, kills about 30% of non-immune populations. Those who survive are left with pockmarks across their body and a lifelong immunity to the disease.\nOriginating in the Eastern Hemisphere, smallpox was first introduced to the Americas shortly after the beginning of the Columbian Exchange. Brought to Santo Domingo in 1519, it spread to the mainland during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, causing widespread devastation across Mesoamerica.",

    "1791 Avignon–Comtat Venaissin status referendum": "In the aftermath of a war between the pro-French Avignon municipal government and the papist Union of St. Cecilia, three mediators sent by the French National Assembly organized a series of votes to discern the true opinions of the people in the Papal territories of Avignon and the Comtat Venaissin with respect to union with France. \nOf the 98 municipalities, 52 voted for France and 19 for the Papal States. Annexation was confirmed by the National Assembly on September 14, 1791.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nWhat eventually became the Comtat Venaissin was acquired by Philip III of France after becoming Count of Toulouse in 1271 who then ceded it to the papacy in 1273. Later, Avignon was sold to the papacy by Joanna I, Queen of Naples and Countess of Provence, in 1348, whereupon the two comtats were joined to form a unified papal enclave geographically, though retaining their separate political identities.\nFor the most part, residents of the two entities never showed much open discontent with their status as subjects of the pope as they were granted special privileges such as little to no tax burden and no military service duties. However, throughout the 1700s, a series of events would come together to intensify a desire among some of the populace for union with France. A big factor was that despite the long rule of the Italian Papal States, the people of the two entities were, as one early 1800s historian put it, \"French by instinct, by language, by character, by nature.\" This situation was opposed to the enlightenment idea of the harmonization of knowledge and practical reality, which caused Avignon, where state boundaries did not correspond with cultural and linguistic divisions, to be seen as a relic of medieval times in an increasingly rational and well-balanced political order. This idea was further enforced in part due to favorable memories of French occupation between 1768 and 1774, which made merchants in Avignon aware of the benefits of formal membership in the French economy.",

    "1819 Balloon riot": "The Philadelphia Balloon Riot occurred at Vauxhall Garden in Philadelphia, PA on the evening of September 8, 1819. After guards beat a boy unconscious for attempting to climb a fence separating the paying guests from those who couldn't afford the expensive entry fee, crowds broke down the fence and ripped the hot air balloon to pieces. \n\n\n== Background ==\nBalloon aviation was a novel phenomenon in the U.S., the first manned flight in a U.S. balloon being accomplished by Edward Warren in Baltimore, MA in 1784. In September 1819 the Franklin Gazette of Philadelphia announced that French aeronaut Monsieur Michel would perform a balloon ascension and parachute leap at Vauxhall Gardens. Tens of thousands arrived to witness the balloon launch, but the one dollar admission fee prevented all but the wealthy from a closer look at the balloon.\nGiven the nature of hot air balloon technology at the time, the success or failure of a given balloon flight was uncertain and suspenseful, as the process of inflation took an extended period of time. Because of \"insufficient gas,\" the balloon at Vauxhall Gardens did not rise and further annoyed the waiting crowd. Frustrated onlookers threw stones and punctured the balloon, whilst others attempted to climb the fence blocking the view. One of these, a boy of fourteen, was beaten by guards for attempting to climb the fence. The sight of the boy, beaten unconscious, aroused the anger of the crowd.",

    "182nd Rifle Division": "The 182nd Rifle Division was formed as an infantry division of the Red Army following the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states, based on the shtat (table of organization and equipment) of September 13, 1939 and utilizing the personnel of two divisions of the Estonian People's Army. At the outbreak of war with Germany it was still in Estonia, part of the 22nd Rifle Corps of Northwestern Front's (former Baltic Special Military District) 27th Army. It quickly lost strength, both due to combat losses and to the desertion of large numbers of ethnic Estonians from the ranks. The remainder concentrated near Porkhov by the beginning of July. During that month the 182nd, now under command of 11th Army, took part in the counterstroke at Soltsy against LVI Motorized Corps, and a further action near Staraya Russa in August, both of which slowed the advance of Army Group North toward Leningrad. During 1942 and 1943, under 11th, 27th, and 34th Armies, the division would repeatedly attempt to regain Staraya Russa, while the battles for Demyansk went on to its east through most of this period. The evacuation of the Demyansk salient in February 1943 freed up German forces to reinforce a much shorter line, which stymied Marshal G. K. Zhukov's Operation Polar Star. The front began to move again during the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive in January/February 1944; Staraya Russa finally fell after holding out for over 30 months and near the end of February the 182nd, now under command of 1st Shock Army in 2nd Baltic Front, won an honorific for its part in the liberation of Dno.

    "1834 massacre of friars in Madrid": "The massacre of friars in Madrid in 1834 was an anti-clerical riot that took place on July 17, 1834, in the capital of Spain during the regency of Maria Cristina and the first Carlist war (1833-1840) in which several convents in the center of Madrid were assaulted and 73 friars were killed and 11 were wounded, because of the rumor that spread through the city that the cholera epidemic that had been ravaging the city since the end of June and that had worsened on July 15 had occurred because \"the water in the public fountains had been poisoned by the friars\". \"The result of little more than twelve hours of violence\" was a \"party of blood and vengeance\". \"It was the first time that the Church had been subjected to the uncontrolled actions of its own believers. As contemporaries observed, these events demonstrated, above all, the loss of prestige of the religious in Catholic Spain, as was happening in other countries\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn April 1834 the regent María Cristina de Borbón-Dos Sicilias promulgated the Royal Statute, a kind of granted charter by which she intended to gain the support of the liberals for the cause of her daughter, the future Isabella II, who was then four years old, and whose inheritance rights had not been recognized by the Carlists, the supporters of the brother of the recently deceased King Ferdinand VII, Carlos María Isidro de Borbón, who did not accept the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830 that abolished the Salic Law that did not allow women to reign, so he lost his rights to the throne in favor of his brother's daughter. After the death of Ferdinand VII, at the end of September 1833, the succession dispute led to a civil war, the first Carlist war, which soon became a political and ideological conflict, between those in favor of maintaining the Old Regime, the absolutists who mostly supported Don Carlos -the \"Carlists\"-, and the defenders of a more or less radical change towards a \"new regime\", who defended the rights to the throne of Isabella II, for which they were called \"Isabelinos\" or \"cristinos\", after the name of the regent. Among the supporters of the \"Carlists\" were most of the members of the religious orders who, besides sharing the absolutist ideas of the Carlists synthesized in their trilemma \"God, Motherland, King\", also feared that the coming to power of the liberals would put an end to their existence. As Julio Caro Baroja pointed out in his pioneering study on anti-clericalism in Spain: \"The cheers for Don Carlos went hand in hand with cheers for the Inquisition, and the rallies of villagers instructed by churchmen were everywhere, especially in Catalonia, the main theater of operations for the rebellions of 1827\".\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Cholera epidemic and \"poisoning of the springs\" ===\n\nBetween 1830 and 1835 a cholera epidemic, which had originated in India around 1817, spread throughout Europe.

As a standard rifle division it took part in the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940. In early 1941 it was selected for conversion to a motorized infantry division, but in fact it had received little in the way of vehicles by the start of the German invasion and so was a rifle division in all but name.

    "1861 State of the Union Address": "The 1861 State of the Union Address was written by the 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, and delivered to the 37th United States Congress, on Tuesday, December 3, 1861, amid the American Civil War, which had begun earlier in the year. This was Lincoln's first State of the Union Address and the first since the start of the Civil War. In regard to that war, Lincoln stated that \"[t]he last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter.\" He also announced the retirement of Winfield Scott as Commanding General of the United States Army and announced the appointment of George B. McClellan to the post about a month earlier.\n\n\n== Content ==\nMuch of Lincoln's address focused on commerce and relationships with foreign nations, especially in light of the Civil War. Lincoln also addressed the fact that there were now three vacancies on the Supreme Court of the United States which he had not yet nominated individuals to fill. He also called for the District of Columbia retrocession, which returned land formerly within the District of Columbia to the State of Virginia, to be undone and for the District of Columbia to regain its former land. \nIt was also in this address that Lincoln recommended reforming the United States circuit court system to ease the burden of hearing cases on the United States Supreme Court, a practice which was much later adopted.  \n\nBesides this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended, the system requires that all the States shall be accommodated with circuit courts, attended by Supreme judges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, California, and Oregon have never had any such courts. Nor can this well be remedied without a change in the system, because the adding of judges to the Supreme Court, enough for the accommodation of all parts of the country with circuit courts, would create a court altogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort.",

Polk, with 63.37% of the vote.\nThis election took place about two months after Tennessee seceded from the Union during the outbreak of the Civil War. Governor Isham G. Harris was a secessionist, while during the campaign, Polk announced that he was in favor of Tennessee joining the Confederacy, However closer to the election he ran on a pro-Union platform. William G. Brownlow, a leader of the state's Unionists, reluctantly endorsed Polk as a lesser of two evils.\nBy the time the campaign had gotten underway, East Tennessee was threatening to withdraw from the state and join the Union, and Polk campaigned as the candidate best suited to reconcile East Tennessee with the rest of the state. He attacked Governor Harris for ordering troops into East Tennessee, arguing the move only served to inflame already-heightened tensions in the region.\nIn the months following the election, Polk traveled to Washington to champion causes for the state's Unionists, including advocating the confiscation of the property of Confederates. In June 1862, after the Union Army had recaptured Nashville, he spoke at a Unionist convention in the city. In September 1862, Polk joined the staff of Union Army general Thomas L. Crittenden.",

One while doing his duty towards the Confederacy, would protect the rights and sovereignty of Georgia.\nHe thought it was best to leave his opponents under the delusion that he would run for another term and so never made any public announcement of his plans to step down. In the meantime, he chose Linton Stephens, junior half-brother of Alexander H. Stephens, from a list of possible people to succeed him. Robert Toombs, Confederate Brigadier General,  was his second choice and Brown was willing to step aside to support either of them.\nStephens refused to run for governor and so Brown turned to Toombs, who having resigned his brigade command in March 1863, returned to Georgia, and it was generally believed that he had political ambitions.

    "1867 State of the Union Address": "On Tuesday, December 3, 1867, at 12:30, Col. Robert Johnson, Andrew Johnson's son and Secretary to the President of the United States, reported the President's annual message to the U.S. House of Representatives. \nThis annual message is notable for having included a passage that historian Eric Foner describes as \"probably the most blatantly racist pronouncement ever to appear in an official state paper of an American President.\" The passage in question is copied below, with emphasis added to most often-quoted phrases:\n\nThe peculiar qualities which should characterize any people who are fit to decide upon the management of public affairs for a great state have seldom been combined. It is the glory of white men to know that they have had these qualities in sufficient measure to build upon this continent a great political fabric and to preserve its stability for more than ninety years, while in every other part of the world all similar experiments have failed. But if anything can be proved by known facts, if all reasoning upon evidence is not abandoned, it must be acknowledged that in the progress of nations Negroes have shown less capacity for government than any other race of people. No independent government of any form has ever been successful in their hands. On the contrary, wherever they have been left to their own devices they have shown a constant tendency to relapse into barbarism. In the Southern States, however, Congress has undertaken to confer upon them the privilege of the ballot. Just released from slavery, it may be doubted whether as a class they know more than their ancestors how to organize and regulate civil society. Indeed, it is admitted that the blacks of the South are not only regardless of the rights of property, but so utterly ignorant of public affairs that their voting can consist in nothing more than carrying a ballot to the place where they are directed to deposit it.",

    "186th Rifle Division (1939 formation)": "The original 186th Rifle Division was an infantry division of the Red Army, formed just before the start of the Second World War, in the Ural Military District, based on the pre-September 13, 1939 shtat (table of organization and equipment). At the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941 it was already moving west, and was soon assigned to the 22nd Army, which became part of Western Front on July 1. After the disastrous frontier battles this Front was attempting to defend along the lines of the Dvina and Dniepr Rivers, with the 22nd on the far right (north) flank. The division was initially quite successful in holding prepared positions near Polotsk, but was outflanked by German crossings elsewhere along the Dvina and forced to retreat. It became encircled west of Nevel, but was able to escape when Velikiye Luki was retaken on July 21. It held positions east of this city into late August when it was struck by a surprise panzer assault and largely overrun, which soon led to Velikiye Luki changing hands again. As the damaged division retreated in late September a former militia division in the far north was assigned the same number, and this anomaly persisted into late June 1943, when the later division was redesignated. The 186th, now in Kalinin Front, took part in the winter counteroffensive which drove a huge salient into the German lines around Toropets, and created the Rzhev salient. By February 1942 the offensive had bogged down, and the following months saw attacks and counterattacks on the west side of the salient, during which the division was fortunate to escape encirclement. Prior to Operation Mars it was transferred to 39th Army, but it played only a minor role in that offensive, and was moved in March 1943 to the reserve near Moscow for rebuilding.",

The Panic of 1873 brought a decrease in property tax revenues, and the state defaulted on its bond payments in 1875.  Following this default, the Democratic Party split into two factions, one of which sought to protect the state's credit at all costs and pay off the bonds in full, and the other rejecting this as unfeasible and suggesting just partial payment of the bond debt. Governor James D. Porter (1875–1879) was of the former faction, and Governor Albert S. Marks (1879–1881) was of the latter, but neither was able to solve the problem.\nBy 1880, the split over the debt issue had left the Democratic Party seriously divided, and Marks declined to run for re-election.

    "1890 women's tennis season": "The 1890 Women's tennis season was a tennis circuit composed of 81 national, regional, county, and regular tournaments. The season began in January 1890 in Chepauk, India, and ended in January 1891 in Dunedin, New Zealand.\n\n\n== Summary of season ==\nFrom 1888 until 1912 Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), grew in status and influence to become the de facto international tennis governing body before the proper International Lawn Tennis Federation commenced operations. Despite the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) forming in 1881 a good seven years before the LTA, it was the British body that set laws, settled disputes and organized the increasingly complicated tournament calendar before the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) formed in March, 1913.\nAfter the formation of the ILTF the world tennis circuit going forward was a highly organised and structured network of national and international tournaments. Most tennis tournaments were usually mixed events for men and women, and the women's international tennis circuit certainly up to 1923 was composed mainly of tournaments on the British and European Circuits. After the USNLTA joined the ILTF this would later change with more and more tournaments being staged globally. Women tennis players on the world circuit up to the open era were funded by their national associations enabling them to travel and take part in international tournaments.\n1890 sees an increase in the number women's singles events being held as the tennis circuit continues to form. The 1890 women's tennis season began on 8 January with the first Southern India Championships staged at  Madras, India.",

The possibly active Waikato Fault in the Auckland region may have been the cause of the earthquake.\nMuch of Auckland felt an intensity of VI (Strong). This quake caused considerable excitement among residents of the city and surrounding areas as earthquakes were rare and none were near the strength of the 1891 event. A few chimneys in the Auckland region were damaged; a few toppled over; and some shop display windows and crockery were shattered.",

Biddle won the game by a score of 4–0.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe first American football game took place in 1869 between Rutgers University and Princeton University. Players at the time wore no helmets, no pads, and attempted no passes, with an emphasis placed on the kicking game (touchdowns were then worth four points and field goals five). The sport was beginning to become popular in North Carolina by the early 1890s, with several schools in the state having teams by that time.\n\n\n== Lead-up ==\nStudents at Biddle University (now known as Johnson C.

During the previous century, several attempts were made to produce glass, but none were long-lived. By 1700, it is thought that little or no glass was being produced in the British colonies that would eventually become the United States. The first American glass factory operated with long–term success was started by Caspar Wistar in 1745—although two glass works in New Amsterdam that operated in the previous century deserve honorable mention. Wistar's glass works was located in the English colony known as the Province of New Jersey. In the southeastern portion of the Province of Pennsylvania, Henry Stiegel was the first American producer of high–quality glassware known as crystal. Stiegel's first glass works began in 1763, and his better quality glassmaking began in 1769. In the United States, the first use of coal as a fuel for glassmaking furnaces is believed to have started in 1794 at a short-lived factory on the Schuylkill River near Philadelphia. In 1797 Pittsburgh's O'Hara and Craig glass works was also powered by coal, and it contributed to the eventual establishment of Pittsburgh as a leading glassmaking center in the 19th century.\nMany of the skilled glass workers in the United States during the 17th and 18th centuries came from the German-speaking region of Europe.",

    "1900 Carlist Sublevation": "The Carlist uprising of October 1900 was an attempted armed insurrection that originated in Badalona, a city on the border with Barcelona, and which spread to other towns in Spain, although the attempted rebellion quickly failed.\n\n\n== Precedents ==\nThe crisis of the Alfonsine monarchy due to the situation in Cuba and in the Philippines, had given new cheers to Carlism. In the climate of tension, in March 1897 isolated groups rose up in Puebla de San Miguel (Valencia) and Castelnou and Calanda (Teruel), which generated a certain social alarm. The newspapers also reported unrest in the Carlist centers of various provinces. However, both the Carlist deputies in Congress and the traditionalist newspaper El Correo Español, assured that the Carlists were calm and that they were not organizing any generalized uprising. The deputy Matías Barrio y Mier strongly condemned the attempt, declaring that the rebels had \"acted impatiently, on their own, following irresistible impulses of their enthusiasm, and disobeying our instructions\"  and stating that \"what is supposed and attributed to us would be unpatriotic in the present circumstances.\"\nThe following year, in April 1898, faced with the imminent war between Spain and the United States after the sinking of the Maine, Don Carlos stated in letter to Vázquez de Mella, who would not do anything that could hinder Spain's victory, for \"not assuming before History the responsibility of the loss of Cuba. However, once the defeat occurred, the Carlists planned a new uprising and had dealings with some generals and military units of the Army.\n\n\n== Conspiracy ==\nIn Madrid the Conspiracy Board was chaired by Marquis of Cerralbo, delegate of Don Carlos in Spain, with count of Casasola as treasurer. Parties would have to be formed in Segovia, Burgos and Valladolid, which would take weapons and uniforms from the Civil Guard. Also involved were the Carlist generals Gutiérrez Solana in Álava and Eulogio Isasi in Vizcaya, as well as a cavalry colonel in Álava and a lieutenant colonel from artillery in Guipúzcoa.",

    "1901 Coupe Vanden Abeele": "The 1901 Coupe Vanden Abeele (English: Vanden Abeele Cup) was a friendly football match held at the ground of Beerschot A.C. in Antwerp, on 28 April 1901. That match was contested by representative teams of Belgium and the Netherlands, and ended in a 8–0 win to the Belgians, but more important than the result was its historical significance, as it was the first international football match played in continental Europe, official or otherwise.\nThe cup was named in honor of the donator of the trophy, Frédéric Vanden Abeele, the Antwerp football director, who organized this match after the huge success of the first edition of the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz in 1900. Due to schedule issues, the Dutch side was ultimately mostly formed by players from a third-level Rotterdam club, Celeritas, at the initiative of its captain, J.C. Jirris, together with Cees van Hasselt, a former Sparta player. This match is not considered official by FIFA because neither team can be considered a full national team since the Netherlands was only represented by players from South Netherlands (Rotterdam) while Belgium had the presence of English players in its squad, such as center-forward Herbert Potts, who scored 7 of \"Belgium's\" 8 goals. Likewise, in those games the Netherlands was announced under the name of \"Van Hasselt XI\", while the hosts were announced as an All-Belgian League XI.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the Easter period of 1900, the Léopold FC organized the first edition of the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, an international tournament for clubs. After the tournament's huge success, Beerschot AC, on whose field the cup was contested, began planning to organize a similar event.\nOn 11 October 1900, Jorge Diaz, the honorary president of the club and future coach of the national team, announced a second challenge to see the best teams in Europe compete in Antwerp. However, the organizers encountered difficulties because the project did not arouse the enthusiasm of the clubs. An alternative is then proposed: pitting the selections of the best players from the Belgian championship and from foreign nations against each other.",

The silk dyers' helpers, an unskilled trade, were mainly from southern Italy and formed the center of Paterson's Italian community. The silk dyers' militant tradition extended from the radical political tradition of immigrants from northern Italy. In the 1890s, Paterson was known as the international home of Italian anarchism. The Paterson Italian community was willing to defend itself against anti-Italian prejudices of the public and police, even if it meant resorting to violence. The community banded together through their conflicts with management and police. Weavers had far more strikes than dye workers in the 1890s. As management could more easily replace and break the strike of unskilled dye workers, dye worker strikes tended to be bigger, such as the property destruction at the hands of dye workers in the 1894 ribbon weavers' strike.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn April 23, 1902, a walkout of silk dyers in Paterson, New Jersey, started a strike.",

However, Spain, Belgium, and British East Africa were unable to participate for unknown reasons, thus leaving the three founding members, France, England, and Bohemia, and Switzerland, which withdrew at the last minute, so the Organizing Committee decided to grant the vacant place to a team from the North of France, made up of players from US Tourquennoise, Stade Roubaisien, Racing Club de Roubaix, and Olympique Lille.

    "1914 California Proposition 20": "California Proposition 20 was a 1914 California ballot initiative known as the prize fights initiative. It passed with 56 percent of the popular vote. \nThe prize fight initiative addressed the question of \"irreligious prize fights\" (as per proponents) versus \"moral boxing\" (according to opponents). It prohibited charging an admission fee for any fight lasting more than four rounds, and prohibited awarding any prize worth more than $25. The wording on the ballot was \"Initiative act amending penal code. Prohibits the engaging in or furthering in any prize fights or remunerative boxing exhibitions, training therefor, or betting thereon; the conducting, participating in or witnessing any boxing exhibition on Memorial Day or Sunday; authorizes regulated four-round amateur boxing exhibitions unless prohibited by ordinances [etc].\"\nAn Oakland sportswriter named Billy Fitz argued that the limitations imposed by the law, restricting fights (that had once gone on as many as 20 rounds) to four rounds would encourage a rush of poorly trained amateurs who would fight more brutally in order to win a shorter match (rather than previous endurance contests which he felt were conducted by well-prepared professional boxers). \nThe 1914 law was repealed with the passage of 1924's California Proposition 7.",

The fire destroyed about a third of Fraser's pier, including the dance hall, much of the Ben Hur roller coaster, a concession building, and part of the scenic railway on the north side of the pier. The explosion of a 100 U.S. gal (380 L; 83 imp gal) gasoline tank on the pier contributed to the destruction.\nConcessions damaged or destroyed included Paris by Night, the Bollinger Baby Little Elizabeth, small Japanese-owned shops, a bowling alley, Esquimaux [Eskimo] Village, Puzzletown, Arabian Village, candy shop, a palm-reader's room, cigar store, and a \"midget village.\" The Davis soda fountain within the dance hall was also a total loss. The Breakers Café was saved. \nThe fire was likely started by an incompletely extinguished cigarette igniting the dance hall, or possibly faulty wiring. Among the people rescued by firefighters was an \"Eskimo babe\" who lived in an Eskimo village attraction on the pier. The Eskimo village usually had huskies on exhibit but they were not present at the time of the fire because they were being used on a film shoot in the mountains.

    "1915–1917 Wheelbarrow Mine strike": "In 1915, coal miners affiliated with the United Mine Workers (UMW) labor union at the Wheelbarrow Mine in Johnson County, Arkansas, went on strike against the mine's operators, the Pennsylvania Mining Company (PMC). The strike ended in 1917 after the PMC declared bankruptcy and a new company, the Fernwood Mining Company, was established to operate the mine and quickly agreed to recognize the UMW.\nThe prelude to strike action at the Wheelbarrow Mine began in 1910 when the existing contract between the UMW and the Anthracite Coal and Land Company, which owned and, at the time, operated the mine, expired without a replacement contract. In October of that year, PMC was established and began operating the mine under a lease from the Anthracite Coal Company. This new company refused to negotiate with the UMW and began to bring in immigrant workers from Pennsylvania to work at the mine, leading to tension and some sporadic instances of violence between these replacement workers and former UMW miners. For the next several years, the UMW attempted to organize workers at the mine and planned for a strike against PMC, and on June 9, 1915, several miners performed a walkout following a change in company policy regarding how miners were compensated for the amount of coal they mined, resulting in a strike.\nFollowing this walkout, UMW officials quickly organized a new local union in Johnson County and made plans for carrying out the strike. Over the next several months, there were several instances of violence between pro- and anti-union sides, and on August 24, a trestle bridge in the county was partially destroyed in an act of sabotage. Following this, UMW official James Moran negotiated with the company a potential end to the strike by the end of the year, but unbeknownst to the union, PMC had by this time initiated legal actions against the union. However, within about one year of filing this lawsuit, PMC declared bankruptcy, in part due to costs associated with the strike and subsequent litigation. PMC ultimately lost the right to operate the Wheelbarrow Mine, and their successor company, the Fernwood Mining Company, quickly recognized the UMW as a collective bargaining organization and negotiated an end to the strike in November 1917.",

    "1916 Rimini earthquakes": "In 1916, two earthquakes of magnitude 5.82 Mw occurred near the border between the regions of Romagna and the Marche in the Kingdom of Italy: at 13:50 CEST on 17 May, and at 09:06 CEST on 16 August.\nWhile the earthquakes caused few fatalities, the 17 May earthquake damaged and the 16 August earthquake destroyed many buildings in the coastal settlements of Rimini, Riccione, and Pesaro, and their hinterlands. 615 buildings in Rimini were demolished after the earthquakes, while 80% of Riccione was razed. Among the lost historic buildings were Riccione's medieval Church of San Lorenzo in Strada and its first marine hospice. Some houses also collapsed in the Republic of San Marino. With the 16 August earthquake occurring at the height of the summer touristic season, the 1916 earthquakes considerably hurt the local coastal economies, already depressed by the First World War.\nThe area around Rimini had suffered earthquakes in 1672, 1786, and 1875. Their frequency had mistakenly led people to expect strong earthquakes only once a century. The 1916 earthquakes are the most recent significant earthquakes to have struck Rimini and its environs. Antiseismic building regulations enforced in 1927 were suspended under Fascist Italy to encourage touristic development; they were reinstated in 1984, after much of the coastline had been developed.",
    "1916 Warsaw City Council election": "Elections to the Warsaw City Council were held in July 1916 – under German occupation during World War I. It was the first modern municipal election in Warsaw, as well as the first local election in Poland after the Russian retreat. The electorate was divided into six curiae, each with 15 seats in the council. As a pre-electoral pact was reached for four out of the six curiae, voting was held only in the Third Curia (intellectuals) and the Sixth Curia (general public). In the Sixth Curia, to which most voters belonged, the winners were the National Democracy on the Polish side and the Folkists on the Jewish side. Per Jesse Kaufmann (2015) \"the election brought to the fore the question of Polish-Jewish relations and triggered an attempt on part of the occupiers to limit Jewish influence while maintaining a facade of strict impartiality\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn July 1, 1915, the German authorities issued call for convening City Councils in occupied Poland based on Prussian model, to replace system of Citizens Committees put in place under Russian rule. On August 6, 1915, the Warsaw Citizen's Committee overtook functions of the city government. The Warsaw Citizens Committee eventually approached the German authorities asking for elections, and on March 23, 1916, the German occupation authorities agreed that the Citizens Committee would be replaced by an elected City Council.\n\nFurthermore, during the spring of 1916, the city boundaries of Warsaw were expanded with suburbs being integrated into the city – on the Vistula River left bank; Czerniaków, Siekierki, Szopy, Mokotów, Ochota, Czyste, Wola, Koło, Powązki, Bielany, Marymont, Buraków and Słodowiec, on the right bank; Golędzinów, Żerań, Szmulowizna, Bródno, Pelcowizna, Targówek, Kawęczyn, Grochów, Saska Kępa, Kamionek and Gocławek.

    "1916 West Coast waterfront strike": "The 1916 West Coast waterfront strike was the first coast-wide strike of longshore workers on the Pacific Coast of the United States. The strike was a major defeat for the International Longshoremen's Association, and its membership declined significantly over the next decade. Employers won control over hiring halls and started a campaign to drive out the union's remaining presence.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe first longshore unions on the West Coast emerged in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) became the dominant union on the West Coast. The craft-unionist ILA came into competition with the Industrial Workers of the World. The IWW was especially strong in the logging and mining industries of the Pacific Northwest, and many of the workers from those industries would work seasonally on the waterfront. In San Francisco, many other unions had recently won an eight hour workday.\n\n\n== Strike called ==\n\nOn June 1, 1916, workers in all twelve West Coast ports went on strike to demand higher wages and an end to the open-shop system. A brief truce was established on June 9 but quickly collapsed after striking workers were killed in San Francisco and Seattle.",

    "1923 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance": "The 1923 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance was an unsuccessful proposal made by the League of Nations to address the issue of disarmament and security in Europe after World War I. It was rejected by the British government in 1924 and was never adopted.\nThe Draft Treaty was an early attempt by the League of Nations to create a system of collective security and disarmament, but it was ultimately rejected by key member states, leading the League to pursue alternative approaches that also ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n\n== History ==\nDisarmament was a high priority for the League, after the terrible experience of World War I. A leading British diplomat Lord Robert Cecil helped prepare the proposal for the League's Temporary Mixed Commission for Disarmament (TMC). \nNevertheless, it proved impossible to come up with a way to enforce disarmament. The dilemma was that if almost everyone was disarmed, the remaining armed power would be very dangerous. In the context of Europe in the 1920s, the specific fear was that Germany could quickly rearm and threaten the neighbour, and the disarmed members of the League would be helpless to stop it. Lord Cecil (at the time a delegate from South Africa) proposed a solution in 1922 called the \"Treaty of Mutual Guarantee\". Every country that signed, and had reduced its armaments according to the agreed schedule, would be protected. If anyone attacked it, the Treaty would guarantee that the victim would be immediately supported by all the other signatories.

It resulted in the establishment of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, mainly because King Alfonso XIII did not oppose the coup and appointed the rebel general as head of the Government at the head of a Militar Directory.\nHistorian Francisco Alía Miranda has pointed out that \"the coup d'état of General Miguel Primo de Rivera [was] atypical for its simplicity. To triumph he only needed the backing of a few prestigious military officers and to publish a manifesto in the press addressed To the country and the Army. The Restoration regime collapsed in a few hours. [...] He did not need more backing from chiefs in command of the troops, for that the shadow of Alfonso XIII was already behind him\".\nJavier Moreno Luzón pointed out that Alfonso XIII \"knew that handing over power to the military entailed a crucial political turnaround. The most important in Spain since the end of 1874, when another coup had facilitated the return of the Bourbon dynasty and the opening of a different stage, the Restoration. To validate that act of force questioned the moderating functions assigned to the monarch by the constitutional texts of 1876...

Their demands were mostly financial (e.g. lower taxes, deferral of loans), but there were also political demands to replace the authoritarian regime of President Antanas Smetona. They began organizing in May 1935 and started a general strike (refusal to pay taxes or sell their products) on 20 August 1935.

Roosevelt made a last-minute decision to move the speech to the evening in order to reach the largest possible radio audience. In the speech, Roosevelt discussed what he felt were the accomplishments of his administration and the New Deal up to that point. House Speaker Jo Byrns remarked that the speech \"very clearly sets forth the major issues of the coming campaign.\"\nIn the closing paragraph of his address, Roosevelt quoted an individual whom he referred to as a \"wise philosopher.\" That individual was Josiah Royce in his 1914 work \"A Word for the Times,\" which Roosevelt quoted by saying\n\n\"What great crises teach all men whom the example and counsel of the brave inspire is the lesson: Fear not, view all the tasks of life as sacred, have faith in the triumph of the ideal, give daily all that you have to give, be loyal and rejoice whenever you find yourselves part of a great ideal enterprise. You, at this moment, have the honor to belong to a generation whose lips are touched by fire. You live in a land that now enjoys the blessings of peace. But let nothing human be wholly alien to you. The human race now passes through one of its great crises.",

    "1937 dispute between Czechoslovakia and Portugal": "A 1937 dispute between Czechoslovakia and Portugal over the sale of 600 machine guns led to a break in diplomatic relations between the two countries that lasted nearly 37 years.\nThe dispute originated with Czechoslovakia's suspicion that Portugal would attempt to transship Czechoslovak machine guns it had purchased to Spain, and Portugal's belief that Czechoslovakia's concern was due to pressure on it from the USSR. \nRelations between Czechoslovakia and Portugal were reestablished in 1974 before breaking down again less than a decade later after the two countries accused one another of hostile covert activities.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHistorically, the Czech lands and Slovakia had few points of intersecting interest with Portugal. In the 1920s, following the creation of the First Czechoslovak Republic, Czechoslovakia and Portugal began interacting with greater regularity. \n\nDuring this period, Czechoslovakia had a massive, domestic arms industry led by Škoda Works. In 1937, Škoda Works alone exported more than Kčs628 million worth of arms. Competition in the international arms trade between German and Czechoslovakian exporters was particularly intense, with the two powers jockeying for domination of continental European arms markets.\nThe Soviet Union had been gradually exercising greater influence in Czechoslovakia and in 1935, concluded a mutual defense treaty with it. By the following year, military exchanges had occurred between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, with the USSR assessing the potential of Czechoslovakia's highly developed network of aerodromes as staging areas for Soviet Air Forces bomber squadrons in a future European war and Czechoslovakia extending credit to the USSR for weapons procurement.\nAgainst this backdrop, Portugal had aligned itself with the Nationalist forces in Spain's ongoing Civil War, which were battling the Soviet-backed Republican faction.",

However, the club managed to save itself from an almost certain disappearance by merging with Club Aviación Nacional, a club that had been founded by three aviation officers.\n4 October: After reaching a pre-agreement in September 1939, the representatives of both sides signed the absorption agreements on 4 October, and appointed the first Board of Directors with Commander Francisco Vives as president of the now Athletic-Aviation Club. Ricardo Zamora was appointed coach of Athletic Aviación, later to become Atlético Aviación.\n5 October: Atlético Aviación played its very first match, the opening fixture of the 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro, which ended in a 1–2 loss to AD Ferroviaria; Julio Elícegui was the author of the team's first goal. Atlético only won one of its first four matches, beating Real Valladolid, but drawing with Imperio CF and losing to Real Madrid CF.\n19 November: Despite this rocky start, however, the team soon found its rhythm and style under the leadership of Zamora, and went on to win each of the remaining six Mancomunado matches, scoring a total of 24 goals for an average of four goals per game while only conceding three, keeping a clean-sheet against both Ferroviaria and Madrid, beating the later on the last matchday on 19 November as they finished level on points, but hedge out Madrid on goal difference, thus winning their first-ever title.\n26 November: At that time, Real Oviedo also had its field destroyed by the war, so it was decided to give up its place to another team, and that final spot was contested by Atlético and CA Osasuna, in a match held in Valencia on 26 November, which Atlético Aviación won with a score of 3–1, with two goals from Enrique and one from Juan Vázquez, thus achieving promotion to La Liga.\n3 December: Atlético Aviación defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in their opening fixture of the 1939–40 La Liga, courtesy of a hat-trick from Enrique, which marked their first-ever win over the Basques in eleven meetings.",

This airstrike killed 23 people and further fueled Afghan support for Pashtunistan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn September 1947, when Pakistan was admitted into United Nations, Afghanistan became the only country which voted against Pakistan’s membership of United Nations and in an open act of hostility against Pakistan, the flag of Pashtunistan was raised alongside the flag of Afghanistan in the Afghan capital of Kabul. Afghanistan initiated the arming and financing of proxies in the border regions of Waziristan and Khyber, namely Afridi Sarishtas and Ipi Faqir, under the banner of 'Liberation of Pashtunistan'. Consequently, numerous skirmishes erupted between Pakistani security forces and Afghan-backed proxies.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nA tribal council was held by Afghan government in the capital Kabul which declared all treaties related to Durand line as null and void and thus declared full support for Pashtunistan, this was accompanied by further financial and military aid to separatists including the establishment of an arms factory.\nOn 31 August, 'Pashtunistan Day' was designated, an occasion consistently observed by the Afghan government. Proxies supported by Afghanistan declared the establishment of 'Pashtunistan' in Tirah (Khyber) and Razmak (Waziristan), appointing Faqir of Ipi as President of the Pashtunistan national assembly.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWaziristan campaign (1919–1920)\nWaziristan campaign (1936–1939)\nWaziristan rebellion of 1948-1954\nBajaur Campaign\nPakistan-Afghanistan skirmishes\nPashtunistan\nFaqir of Ipi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nKaur, Kulwant (1985).",

    "1949 New Zealand crown": "A commemorative crown coin of the New Zealand pound was produced for a planned visit by King George VI in 1949. Having first visited the country in 1927 in his duties as the Duke of York, proposals for a visit by the monarch to New Zealand in 1940 were postponed by the outbreak of World War II. A 1949 tour by the king and queen to Australia and New Zealand was announced in early 1948, the first visit of a reigning monarch to the dominion.\nA Royal Numismatic Society of New Zealand proposal to issue a commemorative coin into circulation was supported by Minister of Finance Walter Nash. Sketches by New Zealand artist James Berry were modelled by Royal Mint designer Percy Metcalfe, and the coin entered production in late 1948. Citing declining health, the king indefinitely postponed the tour in November 1948, sparking fears by the Royal Numismatic Society that the coins may be melted down. The New Zealand government responded positively to calls to continue with the issue of the coinage. Made available at face value at local banks throughout New Zealand in November, the coins were additionally distributed to collectors overseas via consulates-general in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn the decades following the introduction of a domestic pound coinage in favour of the previous British pound sterling coinage, New Zealand produced several commemorative coins. In 1935, the Waitangi crown, of a previously nonexistent five-shilling denomination, was produced in extremely limited numbers and sold to collectors, without entering circulation. With the Waitangi crown's release largely regarded as a failure, the 1940 Centennial half-crown was produced in far larger quantities and entered circulation at face value.",

Truman, the 33rd president of the United States, on Wednesday, January 5, 1949, to the 81st United States Congress in the chamber of the United States House of Representatives. It was Truman's fourth State of the Union Address. Presiding over this joint session was House speaker Sam Rayburn, accompanied by President pro tempore Kenneth McKellar, in his capacity as the acting president of the Senate since the office of Vice President was vacant. (This was because Vice President-elect Alben W. Barkley was not sworn in until January 20, 1949.)\n\n\n== Proposals ==\nThis speech is sometimes referred to as Truman's \"Fair Deal\" speech since in it he declared that \"Every segment of our population and every individual has a right to expect from our Government a fair deal.\" The term Fair Deal came to encompass all of Truman's domestic policy agenda during his time in office. Many of the proposals made in this speech were ones that Truman had previously made to the previous Republican-majority Congress in his 1948 State of the Union Address. Truman reiterated many of them in this address since control of the Congress had shifted in the 1948 United States elections to Truman's Democratic Party. The domestic-policy proposals that Truman offered in this speech were wide-ranging and included the following: \n\nfederal aid to education\na tax cut for low-income earners\ncivil rights laws he had proposed to previous Congresses\na permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission\na farm aid program\nincreased public housing\nnew TVA-style public works projects\nthe establishment of a new Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\nthe repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act, regulating the activities of labor unions\nan increase in the minimum wage from 40 to 75 cents an hour\nnational health insurance\nexpanded Social Security coverage\na $4 billion tax increase to reduce the national debt and finance these programs.\n\n\n== Conclusion ==\nTruman concluded his speech by noting that the United States stood at a consequential place in history and urged the Congress to cooperate with him in rising to the task:\n\nWe stand at the opening of an era which can mean either great achievement or terrible catastrophe for ourselves and for all mankind. The strength of our Nation must continue to be used in the interest of all our people rather than a privileged few. It must continue to be used unselfishly in the struggle for world peace and the betterment of mankind the world over.",

    "1955 riots at the Pakistani embassy and consulates in Afghanistan": "On 31 October 1955, a large crowd of Afghan rioters attacked the Pakistani embassy in Kabul and the Pakistani consulates in Jalalabad and Kandahar after being angered by the Pakistani government's amalgamation of the North-West Frontier Province (and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas) into West Pakistan, which was created by the One Unit Scheme.\nTensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan had existed since the latter was created through the partition of India in August 1947, as Afghanistan refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Durand Line, which Pakistan recognized as the international border between the two countries; Pakistan's modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is perceived by many as an integral part of the Pashtun homeland, and was therefore contested by Afghanistan for much of the 20th century. The Afghan government itself castigated Pakistan's One Unit Scheme, prompting Pakistan to terminate diplomatic ties with the country.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Afghanistan–Pakistan relations ===\nThe relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan were strained since Pakistan gained its independence from United Kingdom with the partition of British India in August 1947. After the partition, the Kingdom of Afghanistan was the only nation to vote against the Dominion of Pakistan's admittance as a recognized sovereign state to the UN. Following Pakistan's independence, Afghanistan sent operatives to operate in the country's northwest, giving away a substantial sum of money, weapons, and transistor radios to try and win over the local populous of Pakistanis to Afghanistan.\n\n\n==== Durand Line dispute ====\nMoreover, Afghanistan did not recognize the Durand Line, which is the Afghanistan–Pakistan border and which Pakistan inherited after the partition of India. Relations between the two countries worsened, and Afghanistan started funding proxies and initiating regular skirmishes with Pakistan along the border.\nThe two states' relations drastically worsened in 1951, when Afghan national Said Akbar Babrak assassinated the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan, in Rawalpindi during a public rally.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn 30 March 1955, a pro-Pashtunistan group attacked the embassy and the ambassador's residence. They also tore down the Pakistani flag, to protest against the unification of the Pashtun-dominated North-West Frontier Province into West Pakistan as part of the One Unit policy.",

The perpetrators were Kurds from the Iraqi Communist Party, the massacre also changed the previously positive Turkmen-Kurdish relationship in Iraq and created a long-lasting ethnic-based stigma. The event is deeply rooted in the collective memory of the Iraqi Turkmen. The massacre is described as an ethnic, rather than political tension.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKirkuk, one of the major cities of Iraq, used to have two main communities before the 1970s: the Kurds and Turkmen. Both of them claimed the city, however unlike the Kurds and Arabs, the Turkmen did not take part in the ethnic-nationalists struggles, although they still tried to maintain their ethnic and cultural identity. According to Mansoor the Turkmen were \"caught in the crossfire between the two large groups.\"\nThe Kurds moved to Kirkuk to avoid the harsh economy in the countryside, increasing their number in Kirkuk due to the oil industry, meanwhile the number of the Turkmen was declining. The demographic change was followed by the appointment of ethnic Kurds in many important posts in the city, which had historical importance to the Turkmen. This made them feel marginalized and outcasted.\nThe massacre took place exactly one year after the Iraqi coup d'etat in 1958, when Qasim became the Primer Minister of the country and declared the republic.",

Instead, it resulted in the further politicisation of Ukrainian dissidents from their previous position of supporting greater self-expression into a movement for greater Ukrainian autonomy under the Soviet Union. Some of those arrested, such as Viacheslav Chornovil, had emerged as leading figures of the strengthened dissident movement since the purge.\nPalace intrigues additionally drove the purge; Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's Dnipropetrovsk Mafia, a group of politicians from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, was opposed to the Kharkiv Clan of Petro Shelest, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine (as well as the smaller Donetsk Clan).

    "1973 New York City gravediggers' strike": "In 1973, approximately 1,700 gravediggers at 47 cemeteries in the New York metropolitan area went on strike due to disagreements over the terms of a new labor contract. The strike, which initially only affected Cypress Hills Cemetery, began on April 12 and had spread to every cemetery whose workers were represented by the Cemetery Workers and Greens Attendants Union Local 365 by June 10. Within a month of this, on July 6, the strike ended after the union and cemetery management agreed to a new contract that included wage increases and a new pension plan. \nFollowing a strike in 1970, Local 365 had negotiated a three-year contract with the management of 47 cemeteries in the metropolitan area that was set to expire on December 31, 1972. This date passed without a replacement due to disagreements over the terms of the contract, with the union seeking weekly wage increases of $12 in each year of the contract, among other benefits regarding pension plans and insurance policies. In January 1973, the union voted to authorize strike action. Over the next several months, negotiations continued with little success. On April 12, the union officially began a strike against Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, and, by the end of the month, the strike had spread to three cemeteries in the region. \nOn June 10, the strike spread to all 47 cemeteries.

Kissinger later tried to return the award, but the committee declined his offer.\nThe 1973 Nobel Peace Prize is often cited as one of, if not the most controversial in the history of the award. Two members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee resigned in protest, The New York Times referred to it as the \"Nobel War Prize\", and Tom Lehrer stated that \"political satire became obsolete\".\n\n\n== Award ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nHenry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ had respectively been the United States and North Vietnamese representatives at discussions beginning in 1968 in Paris, France which aimed to put an end to the Vietnam War. On 26 October 1972, Kissinger held a press conference in Washington, D.C. in which he declared, \"Peace is at hand.\" On 27 January 1973, the Paris Peace Accords were signed. Under the agreement, direct American intervention in the conflict was ended and the remaining U.S. troops were to be withdrawn from Vietnam in exchange for a ceasefire and the cessation of conflict between North and South Vietnam. However, the agreement was not ratified by the United States Senate, and fighting restarted before American soldiers left the country. Additionally, South Vietnam had not been consulted on the terms of the agreement, and in fact had not even been informed that negotiations had resumed. The South Vietnamese government subsequently refused to accept the accords, and North and South Vietnamese forces both frequently broke the terms of the agreement.",

Barcelona had been unbeaten at the top of the league; after matchday 7, the result was annulled and the points were awarded to Barcelona, with Sabadell penalised for having fielded multiple unregistered players in the match.\nTwo of the games hosted by Industria del Taxi, against Barcelona and Espanyol, had to be postponed for Taxi's pitch to be disinfected after hosting a horse show.

    "1976 Big Thompson River flood": "On July 31, 1976, heavy rainfall caused the Big Thompson River in Colorado to crest, causing at least 144 deaths, more than 250 injuries, and least 5 others to be missing.

After cresting at 30 feet (9.1 m), widespread damage and flooding occurred along the river, with the damage totaling almost $150 million (2016 USD).

The development was caused by a number of meteorological factors, including a shortwave trough, a polar front that moved across southeastern Colorado with the main polar airmass northeast of the Front Range, and moisture and unstable air behind a cold front extending across the Big Thompson Valley. Upper-atmospheric light winds caused the thunderstorm complex to stay stationary, which produced heavy rainfall across portions of the Big Thompson Canyon, including up to 7.5 inches (190 mm) of rain falling in one hour.",

    "1981 Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization strike": "The PATCO Strike of 1981 was a union-organized labor strike of air traffic controllers (ATCs). Following a decade of successful strikes in other industries, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) declared a strike on August 3, 1981, demanding higher wages and more benefits. Despite 13,000 ATCs striking, the strike ultimately failed, as the Reagan administration was quickly able to replace the striking ATCs. As a result, PACTO was decertified, and the decline in labor unions in the United States increased.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe years leading up to the PACTO strike saw reform within American labor unions. In the late 60s, corrupt union leaders were called out and replaced by younger leaders, often motivated Vietnam veterans with strong anti-authority positions. The strikes and boycotts organized by these reformed unions were successful in achieving new laws for safety and labor, such as the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972.\nThe increased popularity of air travel in the 1970s brought a burden upon the ATC community, causing long hours, higher stress, and overall discomfort within the workplace. The successful labor movements of the 1960s and 70s inspired PATCO to go on strike in an attempt to reduce stress in the workplace. Many of the workers were veteran Air Force pilots, as well as Republican voters who had backed Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign, so they believed that a strike would be supported and ultimately be successful.",

    "1982 Harmak incident": "1982 Harmak incident  refers to the accidental infiltration of Iranian territory during the Soviet–Afghan War, in which Soviet forces strayed from the target of a Mujahideen base in southern Afghanistan and accidentally destroyed an asphalt factory in Iran.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBy 1982, the Soviet–Afghan War had been raging on for two years, and seemingly wasn't close to an end. The Soviets were in the control of major population centres while the rural areas were mostly under Mujahideen control.\n\n\n== Planning ==\nIn March 1982, the  Soviets decided to destroy a vital supply base at the village of Robat Jaali in southern Afghanistan just a few kilometres from the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran tripoint, given the nickname  of  \"The Bermuda Triangle\" by the Soviets. According to Soviet intelligence, this was a vital Mujahideen base with about 60 militants and huge cache of weapons and ammunition. The operation was planned in Moscow, and to maintain operational secrecy the Soviet military did not inform either the Afghan Army or KHAD as both had many Mujahideen informants.\nThe operation was commanded by General Anatoly Tabunshchikov, who in an Antonov command plane would follow the main strike force and do a photo evaluation of the raid, while the forces themselves would be led by Colonel Vladimir Aprelkin. The plan was complicated as the target was at a large distance and Soviet helicopters couldn't reach the target without refueling. Ultimately it was decided that a force of 600 Soviet troops, including Spetsnaz special forces, would assemble about 50 kilometres from Robat Jaali for refueling on 4 April. The next morning, the target would be bombed by about 12 Su-17s followed by 60 Mi-8 who would capture the target along with all its supplies.",

These events served as a prelude to the subsequent Black July pogrom that followed the killing of 13 soldiers in 23 July, and triggered the Sri Lankan civil war.\nNancy Murray, a member of the council of the Institute of Race Relations, summarised the violence as follows:\n\n\"The two-months pogrom at Trincomalee left the town in ruins, thousands homeless and over 30 dead by the end of July. There was a certain method in all this destruction. For years, the government had been sponsoring Sinhalese settlement of Eastern Districts. These settlers were too willing to take part in acts of aggression against their Tamil neighbors, as part of their expansionist drive.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince the 1930s, the majority Sinhalese government settled Sinhalese in the predominantly Tamil speaking Eastern Province, with the explicit intention to restore what they saw as lost ancient Sinhala settlements, as well as to reduce the Tamils' claim to local autonomy. Sinhalisation of Trincomalee was seen as the key to sundering the contiguity of Tamil habitations in the North and East. Tamil nationalists viewed this as an attempt to alter the demographics of their 'traditional Tamil homeland', thus weakening the Tamils' stake in it.\n\n\n== Pogrom ==\nThe violence began in the first week of June and often occurred during curfew hours, where the security forces would provide 'security' to attacking Sinhalese mobs, whilst also shooting the Tamil victims who fled the scene of attacks for breaking the curfew.",

At the time of the coup, Emirati diplomats went on record as saying ‘Abd al-‘Aziz had been planning the coup \"for years.\"\nSharjah is the third largest emirate in the UAE, with a population of 220,000. The entire Emirate's economy was based on the extraction and refinement of petroleum and other fossil fuels such as natural gas. As such, when oil prices plummeted in 1986, the Emirate was left with around 1 billion USD$ in debt.

    "1990 South Ossetian Supreme Soviet election": "Supreme Soviet elections were held in the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast on 9 December 1990. The disputed elections took place during a period of extreme ethnic unrest in Georgia during the collapse of the Soviet Union. South Ossetia declared independence from Georgia and held elections in response to regional political parties being barred from the 1990 Georgian Supreme Soviet election. In response, Georgia declared martial law, which culminated in the start of the South Ossetian War.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the early stages of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the government of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast, which, established in 1922, did not want to be part of an independent Georgia due to cultural, linguistic, nationalistic and religious differences, but was set to become part of an independent Georgia due to its status as an autonomous oblast of the Georgian SSR. On 10 November 1989 the Supreme Soviet of South Ossetia petitioned the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to change the area's status from an Autonomous Oblast into an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which would be independent from the Georgian SSR. This resulted in a lengthy legal battle between Russian officials in Moscow and Georgian officials in Tbilisi known as the War of Laws. Ultimately, no progress on the issue was made.\nIn August 1990 Georgia outlawed any political party that solely operated in just one specific part of the country, meaning South Ossetian nationalist, autonomist and communist parties could not participate in the Georgian parliamentary election. Following this, on 20 September 1990 the Supreme Soviet of South Ossetia declared the Oblast's independence from Georgia as the \"South Ossetian Soviet Democratic Republic\", a constituent of the Soviet Union. The following day, the Georgian parliament declared that the declaration of independence was illegal. The newly \"independent\" South Ossetia scheduled elections to its Supreme Soviet which where held on 9 December 1990.",

Additionally, in pursuit of Stakhanovite goals of increased productivity, safety requirements were neglected.

In August and September 1991, the protests organized by Chechen National Congress and its leader Dzokhar Dudayev ousted the Communist Party and its leader Doku Zavgayev from power in Checheno-Ingushetia. The leadership of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic also supported removing Doku Zavgayev from office.\nA subsequent conflict between the supporters of Dudayev and Russian authorities led to the Chechen National Congress proclaiming itself as a provisional government in Chechnya before the elections, which were scheduled by the Congress for October 1991. Initially, the executive committee of the CNC scheduled presidential elections for 19 October and parliamentary elections for 27 October, but both were ultimately held on the same date on 27 October 1991.\nOn 15 September 1991, the Assembly of Ingush Deputies passed a resolution, announcing its secession from Checheno-Ingushetia to remain within the RSFSR, thus forming the \"Ingush Autonomous Republic\".

When the party formed it deliberately had no formal leadership, using a \"organic\" rather than \"hierarchical\" structure. This model was briefly tried in the Values Party (outside election years). In December 1991 the Greens became founding members of the Alliance, a five-party grouping that also consisted of the Democrats, Liberals, Mana Motuhake and NewLabour Party. Unlike the Greens the Alliance had a more formalised leadership structure. At the Alliance's inaugural party conference in November 1992 party members elected Green Party member Jeanette Fitzsimons as a co-deputy leader of the Alliance.",

The former Soviet ruble continued to be accepted as legal tender until being taken out of circulation on 12 November 1992.\nFollowing its introduction, the karbovanets was initially slightly above parity with the Soviet ruble due to a shortage of supply compared to demand.

Subsequently, on the 27th of April, the workers walked out on strike.\nOn 6 May, Danish Prime Minister and leader of the Social Democrats Poul Nyrup Rasmussen stated that the strike was \"irresponsible\" and announced measures to end the strike.

    "19th-century peasant rebellions in Korea": "The 19th-century peasant rebellions in Korea were numerous peasant rebellions during the late Joseon dynasty period. Korea suffered from various social problems including economic inequality, high taxes, and corruption. As a result, sparking several peasant rebellions throughout the entire Korean peninsula.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Fall of the hierarchy system ===\nDuring the late Joseon dynasty, a wave of industrialization swept through Korea. As the Korean population grew and the use of coinage spread, an expansive market economy developed. In the agricultural industry, cultivation of cash crops became widespread, and new farming techniques were invented to increase productivity. State-funded handicraft manufacturing gradually declined around the mid-17th century, as private workshops became abundant. In aquaculture, the creation of newer, efficient nets and fishing techniques innovated fisheries. Diplomatic relationships with Japan and China became normalized after the 17th century, which boosted international trade.\nGrowth brought drastic changes to Korea's hierarchy system.",
    "19th Century glassmaking innovations in the United States": "Very few 19th Century glassmaking innovations in the United States happened at the beginning of the century. Only ten glass manufacturers are thought to have been operating in 1800. High-quality glassware was imported from England, and glassmaking knowledge was kept secret. England controlled a key ingredient for producing high–quality glassware and kept its price high—making it difficult for American glass manufacturers to compete price-wise. European glassmakers with the knowledge to produce high–quality glassware were, in some cases, smuggled to the United States. Eventually the American glass industry grew, and the second half of the century saw numerous innovations.\nThe two most significant innovations of the 19th century were mechanical pressing and a new formula for high quality glass. Mechanical pressing increased productivity and allowed more of the public to afford glassware. It was developed simultaneously at several locations during the 1820s. Among those that received pressing-related patents were John P. Bakewell of Bakewell and Company; Henry Whitney and Enoch Robinson of New England Glass Company; and Phineas C. Dummer, George Dummer, and James Maxwell of the Jersey City Glass Works.",

    "19th century glass categories in the United States": "19th century glass categories in the United States include types of glass and decoration methods for glass. A simplified category version appropriate at the beginning of the century is glassware, bottles, and windows. As the century progressed, glass production became more complex and made necessary more categories and subcategories. An 1884 United States government report used glassware, bottles, windows, and plate glass as major categories—although plate glass accounted for only four percent of the value of all glass made.\nAlthough window glass was made using the Crown method or the Cylinder method at the start of the century, the cylinder method was dominant by mid-century. By the 1870s, glassware could be lead crystal or made from soda-lime, with crystal including lead as a key additive while soda-lime glass excludes lead. Glassware could also be decorated by cutting, engraving, or etching. Bottles continued to be made with low–quality green glass, but some bottles were made with high–quality glass and decorated.\nDuring the last decade of the century, wire glass was being produced in addition to window and plate glass. One government report used the category \"building glass\" to represent window, plate, and wire glass.",
    "19th century glassmaking in the United States": "19th century glassmaking in the United States started slowly with less than a dozen glass factories operating. Much of the nation's better quality glass was imported, and English glassmakers had a monopoly on major ingredients for high–quality glass such as good–quality sand and red lead. A tariff and the War of 1812 added to the difficulties of making crystal glass in America. After the war, English glassmakers began dumping low priced glassware in the United States, which caused some glass works to go out of business. A protective tariff and the ingenuity of Boston businessman Deming Jarves helped revive the domestic glass industry.\nThe 1803 Louisiana Purchase added western territory to the United States and eventually opened new markets for glass products. Glass works located along the Ohio River in Pittsburgh and Wheeling were able to take advantage of the nation's waterways to ship their products. Most of the growth of the nation's railroad industry occurred in the second half of the century, which provided an alternative to waterways for transportation. Coal, as an alternative to wood to power the glassmaking furnaces, was another factor that lured glassmakers away from the nation's east coast. By mid-century these factors, along with deforestation in the east, shifted glassmaking away from the east coast to western regions near Pittsburgh and West Virginia.",

During this period, it exercised legislative powers on the behalf of the National People's Congress, which was not yet established.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1945, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT) signed the Double Tenth Agreement in Chongqing in an effort to build a sustainable peace between the two sides. As part of the deals provisions, a Political Consultative Conference was convened on 10–31 January 1946 to draft a new constitution, although the talks ultimately collapsed and the Chinese Civil War resumed.\nOn May 1, 1948, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong called for \"Every democratic party and group, every people’s organization and social dignitary\" to form a new Political Consultative Conference, which would \"discuss and then convoke a people’s representative congress that will turn establish a democratic coalition government\". The appeal created some frictions in minor parties, in the China Democratic Socialist Party, where members of the Reform Faction were leaning towards CCP and supported the declaration on their own initiative. It was also positively received by exiled political leaders in Hong Kong, whose parties were banned under Chiang Kai-shek's government.\nThe first meeting between the \"democratic parties\" and CCP took place in northeast China, which was under CCP control, in August 1948.

He studied architecture at a number of German universities and was appointed a lecturer at the University of Göttingen in 1929. His interests lay in the history of architecture,  the Modernist Movement, and the architecture of England, which he visited as a young man.\nIn 1933, the introduction of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service by the Nazi regime compelled him, on account of his Jewish ancestry, to resign his university office and relocate to England.  During the following years he completed Pioneers of the Modern Movement: from William Morris to Walter Gropius, an important study of Modernism and An Outline of European Architecture. Interned at the outset of the Second World War as an enemy alien, his release, and the end of the war, saw him embark on his monumental work The Buildings of England, a county-by-county gazetteer of his adopted country's most important buildings. Beginning with Cornwall, published in 1951, Pevsner criss-crossed the counties of England; often driven by his wife, Lola Kurlbaum, or by a range of assistants, some of whom, such as John Newman went on to write or revise specific county volumes; visiting buildings during the day, and writing up his notes at night.",

    "2002 Ivorian coup attempt": "The 2002 Ivorian coup attempt was a failed coup d'état in the Ivory Coast against Laurent Gbagbo's government by dissident factions within the Ivorian military that plunged the country into a multiyear-long civil war which tore it into two: the rebel-held North and the government-controlled South. Motives for the coup attempt include frustrations regarding the demobilizing of soldiers instated during General Robert Guei's rule and known for their loyalty towards him. While many of them left as ordered, they refused to hand in their weapons, apparently stashing them for the upcoming coup attempt.\nInvolving as many as 800 soldiers, the coup attempt started on the night of 19 September 2002, with rebel forces staging attacks on three cities - Abidjan, Bouaké, and Korhogo - and managing to seize control of Bouaké and Korhogo while being repelled by government forces in Abidjan. During the day-long battle in Abidjan, General Robert Guei along with much of his family was killed by government forces under the mistaken belief he was the one who orchestrated the coup. The rebel forces later clarified they had no political connections with the general.\nFailing to take control, the rebel forces retreated to the predominantly Muslim North where they managed to garner widespread support among the local populace. The north, inhabited by immigrants from neighboring countries, were seen as foreigners and used as scapegoats for the country's problems, causing a sense of marginalization and lack of representation from the southern-based government. Naming themselves the Patriotic Movement of Ivory Coast (PMCI), the rebels' stated goals were to capture Abidjan, overthrow the government, and organize new elections. Meanwhile, along the Liberian border, new rebel groups - named the Ivorian Popular Movement of the Great West (MPIGO) and Movement for Justice and Peace (MPJ) - staged attacks and captured the cities of Man and Danane, claiming to fight against Laurent Gbagbo's government in order to avenge General Robert Guei's death.",

    "2005 Togolese coup d'état": "The 2005 Togolese coup d'état was the unconstitutional seizure of power by the military in Togo through the appointment of Faure Gnassingbe, son of long-time President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who had ruled the country for 38 years after leading a coup d'état of his own in 1967. On February 5, 2005, President Eyadema suddenly died of a heart attack. Rather than adhering to the Togolese constitution which mandates the Speaker of Parliament act as interim leader until elections are held within 60 days, the Togolese military instead capitalized on the speaker's brief absence during a trip to announce that Eyadema's son Faure Gnassingbe would be sworn in as the new president in order to prevent a \"power vacuum\" from taking place within the country. In a special session of the National Assembly dominated by the Eyadema clan's ruling party - the Rally of the Togolese People (RTP) - Faure Gnassingbe was overwhelmingly approved as the Speaker of Parliament by a wide margin of 67 to 14. A constitutional amendment was also later passed allowing Faure Gnassingbe to serve his father's term that lasts until 2008.\nThe seizure of power sparked mass protests domestically and international condemnation abroad. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) suspended Togo's membership and imposed arms embargoes while the African Union threatened sanctions. Togo was also suspended from the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF).\nIn spite of a two-month ban on protesting to mourn the late leader's death, mass protests were still held in the nation's capital of Lomé where thousands of people demanded Faure Gnassingbe step down. The protests turned violent, resulting in clashes with the military and at least three deaths.",

The mutinies were the first and only major action of the rebellion, which came to an end in the July 2006 Algiers Accords.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the 1990's, Tuareg rebels fought the Malian government over alleged discrimination by southern Malians against Tuaregs from the north in a six-year long rebellion that ended in 1996 with Tuareg rebels being integrated into the Malian Armed Forces. One of the catalysts of the peace agreement during the 1990s was tensions between Ifoghas Tuaregs from northern Mali and Imghad Tuaregs, considered a sub-clan. These groups splintered and reformed often, and neither could explicitly defeat one another or the Malian Army. El Hadj Ag Gamou, an staunchly pro-Malian Imghad Tuareg who was defeated by Ifoghas Tuaregs in the 90s was promoted to the commander of the Malian garrison in Gao over Ifoghas leader Hassan Ag Fagaga. In response, Fagaga and other prominent Ifoghas like Iyad Ag Ghaly and Ibrahim Ag Bahanga created a group called the May 23, 2006 Democratic Alliance for Change (ADC) to desire more autonomy in Kidal Region and among Ifoghas Tuaregs.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nUnder Fagaga's leadership, 150 Malian Tuareg officers mutinied from their posts in Kidal, Menaka, and Tessalit.

    "2006 Taliban offensive": "The 2006 Taliban offensive was a major military offensive launched by the Taliban in southern Afghanistan in the spring of 2006. The offensive was planned to unfold on three main fronts concentrated in the provinces of Helmand and Kandahar: the first front was to target northern Helmand, focusing on the districts of Sangin, Nowzad, and Kajaki. The second front aimed at southern Helmand, with a focus on the districts of Garmser and Nawa. The third, and most important, would be western Kandahar, targeting the districts of Maiwand, Zharey, and Panjwayi.\nThe offensive sparked a resurgence of the Taliban insurgency and marked the most significant escalation of the war in Afghanistan since the Taliban regime was overthrown in 2001. It led to the Taliban gaining control over a considerable amount of territory in the provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Zabul, Uruzgan, Farah, and Ghazni by the year's end, in which the Taliban established their own administration based on Islamic law, operating independently from the Afghan government.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the end of 2001, the Taliban regime was eliminated, but the movement continued to pose a threat to the newly established US-backed Afghan government. Many Taliban fighters and most of its leadership escaped into Pakistan, some of them by being directly airlifted from the northern city of Kunduz by the Pakistani Air Force. This set the stage for a resurgence of Taliban activity with direct support from Pakistan.

This promotion prompted members of the Ifergenoussen sub-clan of Kel Adagh to form the May 23, 2006 Democratic Alliance for Change, focused on gaining more autonomy for Kidal Region.\n\n\n== Rebellion ==\nThe rebellion began on May 23, 2006, at the Malian army bases in Kidal and Menaka, with ADC-affiliated Tuareg officers mutinying and looting arms at their bases. The rebels then retreated to remote bases in the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains in northern Kidal Region. The ADC was led by Hassan Ag Fagaga, who had been passed over for promotion in favor of Gamou, and Ibrahim Ag Bahanga, Iyad Ag Ghaly, and Ahmada Ag Bibi joined the group shortly afterward. Ghaly took the reins of the rebellion early on and attracted many Ifergenoussen rebels, although the group was not entirely Ifergenoussen.",

    "2006 anti-Tamil riots in Trincomalee": "2006 anti-Tamil riots in Trincomalee were a series of organized violence against the Tamil population of the Trincomalee town and its outskirts in eastern Sri Lanka that followed a bomb blast on 12 April 2006. The violence was mainly carried out by Sinhalese mobs, Navy personnel and home guards with the overall complicity of the Sri Lankan security forces and police. By 20 April, the violence had left over 20 civilians dead, 75 injured, over 30 shops and 100 houses burned, and over 3,000 people displaced.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTrincomalee District has long been an flashpoint of ethnic conflict with nearly equal proportion of the country's three major ethnic groups. The state's policy of settling Sinhalese peasants in predominantly Tamil areas had reduced the Tamil population of the district from 64.8% in 1881 to 33.7% by 1981. This issue was a major bone of contention between the two communities, with Tamil leaders resisting what they saw as attempts by successive Sinhalese-led governments to alter the demography of the traditional homeland of the Tamil-speaking people, thus marginalizing them politically and culturally. With the beginning of the Sri Lankan civil war, the Sri Lankan armed forces had launched a policy of forcibly displacing the Tamil population of the district in the mid-1980s, depopulating entire villages, to break the territorial contiguity of traditional homeland claimed by Tamil nationalists.\nThe progressive Sinhalisation of the Trincomalee town and the resultant decline of Tamil influence also extended to its trading sector with decade-long efforts to drive the Tamils out of it. It was in this context of insecurity felt by the local Tamils that the latest spate of communal unrest was sparked by the illegal erection of a Buddha statue behind the town's main market on 15 May 2005 by Sinhalese nationalist groups with the support of the Navy's Eastern Commander, Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera. This was opposed by the local Tamils as an act of provocation by Sinhalese Buddhists and the ensuing protests and violent incidents led to the security forces being reinforced in the area to protect the statue.",

A large scale trough was predicted to move across the northern United States, with associated moisture return from the Gulf of Mexico and ample instability forming a classic plains severe weather setup.\nBy May 21, models showcased an increasingly strong and robust negatively-titled trough rapidly moving across the United States before slowly stalling through the central plains. A large ridge present was set to breakdown, allowing a strong surface front to move across the area as well. Moderate instability was already forming due to a deep forming moist-layer and warm air advection from the south. The National Weather Service indicated that the \"Combination should be sufficient for a multiple-day threat for relatively widespread severe storms.\"\nOn May 25, notices for a moderate risk of severe weather were issued for northern Kansas, southern Nebraska, eastern Minnesota, northeastern Iowa, and western Wisconsin with a slight risk from Texas to northwestern Ontario. Watches extended along all the corridor and storms developed in four different areas including northern Texas, northern Kansas, central Minnesota and Iowa and southern Manitoba. As forecast, the strong trough would dig into northern areas of the CONUS. A stronger than forecast low-level jet began to transport ample moisture northward towards the interest area for severe storms, and as early as 12:30 pm CDT strong instability began to climb, as well as dew-points in the upper 70s.

News footage of the event from a KCBS helicopter led to intense media coverage and speculation about a potential military missile launch, with many reporters and experts discussing the contrail and theorizing about its source.\nCoverage continued for several days. The Pentagon released a statement on November 9 that it could not identify the source of the vapor trail, but both the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and U.S. Northern Command stated it was not a foreign military launch. On November 9, the FAA also issued a statement that it had not approved any commercial space launches in the area for the prior day. Eventually, on November 10, about 30 hours after the contrail first gained press attention, a Pentagon spokesman stated there was no evidence to suggest the plume was anything but an aircraft contrail. Some experts, however, held that the vapor trail could not be identified as an aircraft contrail with total certainty, and others stated it was a missile.\nWhile some uncertainty over the contrail's origin persisted, the incident came to be seen as an example of news outlets being \"captives of their sources\" and irresponsibly pushing unverified theses; it was also interpreted as a lesson in the importance of exploring alternative hypotheses that fit available data. U.S. federal and military authorities were also criticized for giving a series of \"inconclusive\" answers about the event and allowing the issue, in the words of one commentator, to \"fester for days\" without a clear resolution.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nContrails, short for \"condensation trails,\" are linear cloud formations produced by aircraft exhaust or air pressure changes, usually at commercial cruising altitudes several miles above the ground.",

    "2010 Oklahoma State Question 755": "State Question 755, also known as the Save Our State Amendment, was a legislatively-referred ballot measure held on November 2, 2010, alongside the 2010 Oklahoma elections. The ballot measure, which passed with over 70% of the vote, added bans on Sharia law and international law to the Oklahoma state constitution. However, the amended language never went into effect; a challenge in federal court successfully argued that it violated the First Amendment to the United States federal constitution.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe amendment was introduced as House Joint Resolution 1056. State Representative Rex Duncan was the primary author of the amendment, with Mike Reynolds, Ann Coody, Sue Tibbs, David Derby, Sally Kern, Randy Terrill, John Enns, Mike Christian, George Faught, Lewis H. Moore, and Charles Key as coauthors in the House, with Anthony Sykes and Randy Brogdon as coauthors in the Oklahoma Senate. According to Duncan, Oklahoma would be the first state to enact a Sharia law ban, which would be a \"pre-emptive strike against Sharia law\".\nThe amendment was part of a nationwide movement against Sharia law, following a case in New Jersey when a woman was denied a restraining order against her husband after she alleged that he raped her; her husband argued that he was acting in accordance with his religious beliefs in forcing her to have sex. This case, though later overturned, was cited by Patrick R. Wyrick, Oklahoma's solicitor general, as part of his attempt to defend the amendment in court.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe original ballot title for the question, as suggested by the legislature, did not explain what Sharia law or international law were; Oklahoma attorney general Drew Edmondson replaced it with a more explanatory ballot title.\nThe proposal was listed on ballots as follows:\n\nThis measure amends the State Constitution.",

Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Junior momentarily took refuge in a foreign embassy. Government officials later clarified it was actually an attempt by a group of soldiers trying to overthrow the government during a press conference.\nIn the end, 30 perpetrators were arrested, among them being the Navy Chief for \"masterminding the coup.\" More skirmishes were executed by the army to make further arrests, including politicians, that resulted in a single casualty along with many more being injured.

It resulted in voters retaining incumbent Republican lieutenant governor Rebecca Kleefisch over the Democratic candidate Mahlon Mitchell. Kleefisch's retention made her the first lieutenant governor to run in and survive a recall. Primary elections took place on May 8, 2012.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Gubernatorial succession ===\n\nThe lieutenant governor is established within Article V of the Wisconsin Constitution as the first person in the line of succession of Wisconsin's executive branch, and serves as governor in the event of the death, resignation, removal, impeachment, absence from the state, or incapacity due to illness of the governor of Wisconsin.\nGubernatorial succession came into focus during the recall, as under Wisconsin law, the lieutenant governor is \"acting governor\" whenever the governor leaves the state. This arrangement, paired with the recall election, could have led to a scenario where the governor was of one party, and the lieutenant governor was of another party.\nWhile acting as governor, the lieutenant governor has all the powers of the governor, though the impacts would be limited as the governor, upon their return, can immediately reverse any actions taken in their absence.\nDespite speculation, such a scenario never came to pass as Kleefisch won re-election by 5.8%.\n\n\n=== 2012 Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election ===\n\nDespite holding an office with little to no actual power, serving an almost entirely ceremonial purpose, Kleefisch faced similar anger from Wisconsinites regarding her role in Walker's efforts to weaken collective bargaining rights.",

On the morning of that day, veterans who had participated in the War in Donbas asked Opposition Bloc supporters at the event to remove the party flag with Soviet connotations and the Ribbon of Saint George, which is illegal in Ukraine, and then conflicts broke out. There are reports that the National Police of Ukraine not only failed to crack down on illegal opposition supporters, but also collaborated with Titushky to help beat soldiers. Witnesses said police used tear gas, smoke grenades and baton attacks during the fights.\nThe chief of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Police, the chief of the Dnipro Police Department and his deputy were dismissed following the incident.

    "2017 Equatorial Guinea coup attempt": "The 2017 Equatoguinean coup attempt was the failed coup d'état in Equatorial Guinea by foreign mercenaries against President Teodoro Obiang Nguema's government. The coup attempt began on December 24, when foreign mercenaries hailing from the countries of Chad, Sudan, and the Central African Republic (CAR) infiltrated Kye Ossi, Ebibeyin, Mongomo, Bata and Malabo, aiming to attack the president in his presidential palace at Koete Mongomo. State security intercepted the mercenaries in the town of Ebibeyin, resulting in clashes which claimed the life of one of the attackers. Cameroon later reported the arrests of thirty-eight armed fighters along its border with Equatorial Guinea, among them being former Chadian general Mahamat Kodo Bani. The coup attempt was reportedly led by him.\nThe government promptly capitalized on the purported coup bid to further tighten its grip on power and initiated a crackdown on the country's political opposition, citing the involvement of \"certain radical opposition parties\" in recruiting the foreign mercenaries. Opposition activist Santiago Ebee Ela died in the custody of the government following his arrest on January 2, allegedly due to the torture he endured from state security.\nAnalysts suspect the coup attempt was entirely fabricated by the regime to target political opponents. Two potential motives were suggested: Elites within the country frustrated with the succession plan involving Teodoro's son, or those within the president's camp manufacturing an excuse to deal with the political opposition.\nFollowing the foiled coup attempt, Chad's foreign minister Mahamat Zene Cherif denied any involvement in the coup bid while the dispatched United Nations (UN) envoy to Malabo assured the government of continued support in stabilization efforts.",

    "2017 Maltese Presidency of the Council of the European Union": "Malta held the presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of 2017.  The presidency was the last of three presidencies making up a presidency trio, which began with the presidency of the Netherlands, followed by that of Slovakia.  It was the first time Malta had held the presidency.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Maltese presidency opened with the intent to focus on six areas of interest: (1) expanding the European single market, (2) fostering growth in the maritime sector, (3) helping neighbouring countries with their development, (4) implementing rules regarding asylum and immigration, (5) improving interstate cooperation regarding criminal justice and external borders, and (6) reducing social discrimination.  The presidency was also tasked with dealing with the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (Brexit), after the formal notification of the intent to withdraw was received in March.\nAfter the family of Maltese prime minister Joseph Muscat faced a number of allegations in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal, Muscat opted to call a snap election a year before his term was scheduled to end.  Although Muscat won the election, which was held in June, the decision to call an early election was not looked upon favourably by leaders in the European Union.\nAt the end of the term, Politico Europe remarked that the Maltese presidency \"turned out to be rather good\".  The review gave the Maltese presidency full marks on the topic of Brexit, where the presidency kept the 27 countries negotiating against the United Kingdom unified, and on the topic of fisheries, where an agreement was made over a matter that had been open for more than a decade.\nDuring a plenary session of the European Parliament in July, only a few dozen members showed up to review the Maltese presidency, leading European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to call the legislative body \"ridiculous\" for not giving the presidency of Malta, the smallest member state of the union, the same respect it would for those of larger countries.",

Around this time, Dogon dozos formed Dan Na Ambassagou militias in Dogon areas, which were armed by the Malian government. This made inter-ethnic conflict not just between Dogon and Fulani, but often also between the jihadist Katiba Macina and the larger Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin against the pro-government Dan Na Ambassagou. In the area of the massacres, Dogon militants had recently launched attacks against Fulani villages.\n\n\n== Massacres ==\nAround sixty motorcycles attacked the village of Pangadougou around 3pm, killing one person.

Catalytic converters became mandatory in American automobiles following the Clean Air Act of 1975, but are easy to surreptitiously remove from vehicles.\nAccording to a 2023 report by the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NCIB), metal recyclers will often \"pay between $50 to $250 for a catalytic converter and up to $800 for one that was removed from a hybrid vehicle.\" The devices are typically much more valuable to the theft's victim: \"it can cost between $1,000 and $3,500 or more to replace a catalytic converter that is stolen, depending on the type of vehicle.\"\nFrom 2001 to 2021, the price of PRP rose dramatically: platinum rose from $530 per ounce to about $1100 ($912.00 to $1,237, adjusted for inflation).

It codified reproductive rights in the Constitution of Vermont.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn the 19th century, bans by state legislatures on abortion were about protecting the life of the mother given the number of deaths caused by abortions; state governments saw themselves as looking out for the lives of their citizens. Vermont's first ban on abortion was passed in 1846. It read:“Whoever maliciously, or without lawful justification with intent to cause and procure the miscarriage of a woman, then pregnant with child, shall administer to her, prescribe for her, or advise or direct her to take or swallow any poison, drug, medicine or noxious thing, or shall cause or procure her, with like intent, to take or swallow any poison, drug, medicine or noxious thing, and whoever maliciously and without lawful justification, shall use any instrument or means whatever, with the like intent, and every person, with the like intent, knowingly aiding and assisting such offenders, shall be deemed guilty of felony, if the woman die in consequence thereof, and shall be imprisoned in the state prison, not more than ten years, nor less than five years; and if the woman does not die in consequence thereof, such offenders shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor; and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison not exceeding three years, nor less than one year, and pay a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars.”\nIn 1970, the Vermont Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state's abortion ban in the context of the Constitution of the United States in State v. Bartlett. However, the court overturned the ban less than two years later in Beacham v. Leahy based on the Vermont Constitution.\n\n\n== Text ==\nPersonal reproductive libertyThat an individual’s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one’s own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.",

    "2023 FW14": "2023 FW14 is a small asteroid orbiting near the L4 point of Mars (60 degrees ahead of Mars on its orbit). As of March 2024, it is the second known asteroid to orbit the leading L4 point of Mars together with (121514) 1999 UJ7, although at least 15 other asteroids orbit Mars's trailing L5 point, including 5261 Eureka, (101429) 1998 VF31, and 2007 NS2. Not only does 2023 FW14 orbit on the other side of Mars from other similar asteroids, its spectrum is different as well, but close to that of (121514) 1999 UJ7.\n\n\n== Orbit ==\n2023 FW14 orbits around the L4 point of Mars in a somewhat stable orbit and it may be affected by the Yarkovsky effect. It is far less stable than (121514) 1999 UJ7. Its initial orbit was eventually improved when precovery images were found. Its current orbit is of the Amor type. Its orbital evolution into the past strongly suggests that it cannot be a primordial trojan like Eureka. \n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nIts spectrum suggests that it is an X-type asteroid, which is different from 5261 Eureka and 1998 VF31 but compatible with that of (121514) 1999 UJ7, and this is somewhat puzzling since different mineral compositions suggest different origins for the two groups of asteroids. Asteroid 2023 FW14 might have been captured from the Mars-crossing near-Earth asteroid population; alternatively, it might be a fragment of (121514) 1999 UJ7 produced in situ nearly 1 Myr ago.",

Reports of bedbug sightings began in rental and hotel accommodations in the summer of 2023, and escalated to public spaces, including movie theaters and transport systems, over the following months. The outbreak caused national upset and drew significant media attention, with both local and international actors calling on the French government for a more serious response to the situation. This outbreak occurred less than a year before the start of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, raising concerns about the city's ability to safely host tourists and locals traveling for the occasion.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Previous bedbug infestations in France ===\nBedbug infestations have been reported as early as the times of the Ancient Greeks, but were largely eradicated in the mid-20th century thanks to the development of strong pesticides, such as DDT. A resurgence of bedbug infestations occurred in the late 1990s and has continued to evolve since then. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants signed in 2004 is cited as one of the causes for this change, as the banning of powerful pesticides led to a proliferation of this parasite. Globalization and more frequent international travel is also frequently cited as a cause.\nAccording to a report published by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) in July 2023, more than 1 in 10 French households was infested with bedbugs between 2017 and 2022. A different estimate placed France's peak infestation at 32% households in 2019, and the figures lowered in 2020 with the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic and global travel restrictions.\n\n\n=== Initial sightings and \"Mass Hysteria\" ===\nFollowing the publication of the ANSES report in July 2023, French media outlets began reporting more frequently on the presence of bedbugs in households and public spaces.",

    "2023–2024 Bangsamoro measles outbreak": "The 2023–2024 Bangsamoro measles outbreak is an outbreak of measles affecting the autonomous region of Bangsamoro in the Philippines since 2023. An outbreak was first declared in Lanao del Sur on October 9, 2023, with a region-wide outbreak later declared on March 21, 2024.\n\n\n== Outbreak ==\n\n\n=== Outbreak in Lanao del Sur ===\nSince April 29, 2023, there are documented cases of people experiencing measles symptoms Lanao del Sur. This was observed in the population of Marawi on June 6, 2023 primarily affecting people below ten years old. An increase of trend of measles cases in different provinces of Bangsamoro was observed from August 6 to September 3, 2023 which led to the declaration of a measles outbreak on October 9, 2023 in Lanao del Sur and Marawi on October 9, 2023.\n\n\n=== Regional outbreak ===\nThe measles outbreak was declared in the Bangsamoro region by the local Ministry of Health (MOH) on March 21, 2024. The declaration came after 592 cases and 3 deaths were record in the Bangsamoro since January 1 of that year. Majority of the cases were in Lanao del Sur with 220 people infected.\nThe national Department of Health expressed confidence that no outbreak will happen in other regions of the Philippines. The national health department says that it was only the Bangsamoro region which has not attained herd immunity against measles and rubella with 50 percent coverage – the reason which it states that the outbreak has occurred in the region.",
    "2023–2024 El Niño event": "The 2023–2024 El Niño was regarded as the fourth-most powerful El Niño–Southern Oscillation events in recorded history, resulting in widespread droughts, flooding and other natural disasters across the globe. The onset was declared on 4 July 2023 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) It was estimated that the most significant meteorological effects would occur between November 2023 and April 2024 and their characteristics would be determined depending on each territory on the planet, within which droughts, heavy rains, wildfires, heat waves, tropical cyclones, flooding and changes in wind patterns. These events have already negatively affected the economic activities of agriculture and fishing, generating shortages and rising prices of food—especially rice, palm oil, sugar cane, soybeans and corn—and, therefore, an increase in food insecurity of the most vulnerable populations.\nClimate scientists say the 2023–24 El Niño event, exacerbated by the climate change crisis, will likely raise average global temperatures beyond the record set in 2016—during the 2014-2016 El Niño event—and will set new records for temperature in 2024, exceeding the 1.5 °C increase since pre-industrial times.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nEl Niño is a natural climate event caused by the Southern Oscillation, popularly known as El Niño or also in meteorological circles as El Niño-Southern Oscillation or ENSO, through which global warming of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean results in the development of unusually warm waters between the coast of South America and the International Date Line. This phenomenon significantly affects the global average surface temperature of the planet. A large El Niño event can raise it by as much as a few tenths of a degree Celsius.\n\n\n== Meteorological progression ==\nDuring an El Niño event, the east–west trade winds die, generating warmer air temperatures in the eastern and central parts of the tropical Pacific. Warmer temperatures lead to warming ocean surface temperatures, leading to heavier rainfall and flooding in the eastern Pacific. Since there are no trade winds, the necessary rains do not form in the western Pacific, generating droughts in Asia and Oceania.",
    "2023–2024 French government crisis": "In December 2023, the Borne government faced a governability and credibility crisis. It was caused mainly by the difficult passage of the 2023 immigration and asylum bill, one of Emmanuel Macron's flagship manifesto commitments made during the 2022 presidential election.\nThe immigration reform bill was a draft legislation introduced in Parliament on 1 February 2023 by Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin. It was received negatively by opposition parties, in particular by the conservative Republicans (LR) who both hold a majority in the Senate and the balance of power in the National Assembly. The bill, whose legislative process was stalled for many months, was unexpectedly defeated in the National Assembly on 11 December, ultimately leading to Darmanin offering his resignation and Macron sending the bill to a joint parliamentary committee. The conservative-dominated joint committee agreed on a much tougher bill which earned the surprise endorsement of Marine Le Pen, causing confusion and anger inside Macronist ranks.\nSeveral ministers, in a major breach of collective ministerial responsibility, openly threatened to resign if the bill was passed, while scores of MPs from the three Macronist parliamentary groups in the Assembly, including joint committee chair and prominent left-leaning figure inside Macron's camp Sacha Houlié, announced they would vote against the bill.\nAfter the bill was passed on 19 December, Health Minister Aurélien Rousseau immediately resigned to protest against it meanwhile Higher Education Minister Sylvie Retailleau offered her resignation to protest measures affecting foreign students but remained in post after Macron gave her reassurances. Other ministers publicly voiced their opposition to the bill but did not act further on it.\nIn early January 2024, in spite of earlier public statements in which she expressed her intention to carry on as Prime minister, Borne reluctantly resigned at Macron's request.",
    "2023–2024 German farmers' protests": "The 2023–2024 German farmers' protests are a series of ongoing nationwide protests and road blockages in Germany organized by farmers and agricultural unions since 18 December 2023. The subjects of the protests are the abolition of tax breaks on farmers and the policies of the federal government.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn its ruling of 15 November 2023, the Federal Constitutional Court declared the second supplementary budget for 2021 as unconstitutional and therefore invalid. The German Bundestag, under the leadership of the Scholz cabinet, had attempted to use the unused debts of the COVID-19 \"special fund\" for the 2021 budget. This resulted in a budget deficit of 17 billion euros for the 2024 federal budget. Among the measures taken by the federal government to remedy this were the introduction of a motor vehicle tax and the cancellation of the crude oil tax refund for farmers.\nVarious commentators put forward alternative ideas on how the budget deficit could potentially be eliminated by other means.\nThe agreement reached by the federal government is predicted to lead to greater financial burdens in 2024, particularly for those with a low to average income, while relieving the burden on those with a higher income. For the agricultural sector, the responsible minister Cem Özdemir (The Greens) announced the abolition of subsidies for agricultural diesel and the introduction of a vehicle tax for agricultural vehicles (previously green license plates).\nAccording to a report published by the German Farmers' Association (DBV) in December 2023, German farmers in main occupation achieved an average profit of 115,400 euros in the 2022/2023 financial year, which is an \"all-time high\" and around 45 percent more than in the previous year.",
    "2023–2024 Gilgit-Baltistan protests": "The 2023–2024 Gilgit-Baltistan Protests, or Wheat protests in Gilgit-Baltistan are a series of protests, sit-ins, and demonstrations against the Federal Government of Pakistan and the Government of Gilgit-Balitistan in response to the dramatic increase in wheat prices in the region. Many of the protests have been organized by the Awami Action Committee.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe sudden increase in prices of wheat sparked protests in Gilgit-Baltistan against the Government of Gilgit-Balitistan and the federal government. The price of the then subsidized wheat has been raised by the GB government from Rs20 kg to Rs36 kg, which had already increased from Rs12 per kilogram to Rs20 per kg in June 2023 by the administration, which was led by the then Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid Khan.\n\n\n== Protests ==\nSeveral political parties, civil society organizations, labor unions, and representatives of the travel and tourism industries were among the protestors who voiced their dissatisfaction with the GB administration on Friday, 22 December 2023 during a march that left Jamma Masjid and went to Yadgar-i-Shuhada in Skardu, In addition to other locations in Diamer, Nagar, Hunza, Astore, Ghanche, Ghizer, Shigar, and Kharmang, the protests were staged on Tuesday at Yadgar-i-Shuhada Skardu, Siddiq-i-Akbar Chowk Chillas, and Etehad Chowk Gilgit.\nFollowing talks with the government, the Awami Action Committee, a collection of regional political, religious, and local parties, has resolved to stage protests indefinitely. GB Chief Minister Gulber Khan stated that the federal government was requesting increases in the price of wheat on a regular basis.\nDespite the protests, the government hasn't shown interest in lowering the wheat prices and the cooperation between the Finance minister Muhammad Ismail and the government has not resulted in any change.\nDespite the protests starting on 22 December 2023. However, the protests were officially called on 23 December.",
    "2023–2024 Japanese slush fund scandal": "Beginning in November 2023, a scandal involving the misuse of campaign funds by members of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan's conservative Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai and Shisuikai factions became public after it was revealed the faction had failed to report over ¥600 million in campaign funds and stored them in illegal slush funds. The scandal has led to discussions regarding the future of the LDP and its political dominance in Japan.\nOn 18-19 January 2024, three factions of the Liberal Democratic Party (Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai, Kōchikai, and Shisuikai) all announced their intention to dissolve to form a war cabinet. Several Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers were indicted, including incumbent lawmakers Yasutada Ōno and Yaichi Tanigawa, who both resigned from the party following their indictments.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party has been the dominant party in Japanese politics since its formation in 1955. The dominance of the LDP, referred to popularly as the 1955 System, has only been interrupted twice: between 1993 and 1994, as a result of corruption scandals and the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, and from 2009 to 2012 as a result of continuing economic crisis during the Lost Decades. The LDP later recovered both times; in 1994 by forming a coalition with the Japan Socialist Party, and in 2012 as a result of the Fukushima nuclear accident a year prior.\nThe LDP has numerous factions, but since 2012 has been dominated by the right-wing Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai, also referred to as the Seiwakai or Abe faction. Formerly led by Shinzo Abe (for whom it is nicknamed), the Seiwakai continued to wield significant influence even after Abe resigned as Prime Minister in 2020. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is a member of the liberal Kōchikai faction, which competes with the Seiwakai for influence.",
    "2023–2024 video game industry layoffs": "Beginning in 2023 and continuing into 2024, the video game industry has experienced mass layoffs. Over 10,000 jobs were lost in 2023, and an additional over 9,500 jobs were lost in 2024 from January to May. These layoffs had reverberating effects on both established game development studios and emerging companies, impacting employees, projects, and the overall landscape of the gaming industry. The layoffs caused several video games to be canceled, video game studios to be shut down or divested from their parent company, and thousands of employees to lose their jobs.\nMost of the job cuts occurred in North America and Europe, with video game industry in the United States being the most affected, followed by Canada, United Kingdom and Poland. Over 30 video game development studios laid off their entire staff and shut down.  A new survey by the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), based on 2023 data, suggests a global unemployment rate of 4.8% within the game industry. Some industry experts believe that the rate in the United States could now be twice as high.\nExecutive Director of Circana (The NPD Group), Mat Piscatella suggests that the most optimistic projection indicates a potential decrease of about 2% for American video game industry in 2024. However, a more pessimistic perspective could see a decline of around 10%, with the possibility of an even greater downturn if conditions worsen significantly.",

Due to this, Tachibana would resign as the party's leader on a press conference, where he announced former child actress Ayaka Otsu as his successor, and the rebranding of the party to Seijika Joshi 48 tō (政治家女子48党, Politician Girls 48 Party).\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn 7 April 2023, Tachibana held a press conference and announced that Otsu had been expelled from the party on the previous day, stating that Otsu \"posed a risk of dissolving the party.\" Tachibana then announced that he would return to the position of party leader.

Many of the protests were organized by the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) of Azad Kashmir, representing a variety of interests including traders, transporters, lawyers and students. The government attempted to preempt a planned demonstration on 12 May by arresting the movement's leaders, which inflamed protests and led to deadly clashes. The protests were the culmination of a year-long movement against price rises and perceived injustices towards Azad Kashmir. The Federal government announced a Rs23 Billion ($82,685,321) grant to Azad Kashmir, which led to subsidized utility rates and wheat prices being announced on May 13, by the Prime Minister of AJK, Chaudhry Anwar-ul-Haq. On May 14, the JAAC called off the protests, announcing a ‘historic win’ as the government agreed to all demands.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Recent Developments ===\n\nMeanwhile, protests were occurring in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan as well as several other regions across Pakistan for relief due to massive inflation and high food prices coupled with huge electricity bills.

Pakistan was going in a tough time with floods and political instability combined with insurgencies intensifying. Pakistan's elections were planned for February and this would play a key role as It is believed, with some evidence, that Pakistan's elections were rigged by the government agencies which contributed to a divided electoral result with PPP taking Sindh, MQM taking Karachi, PML-N takeover of Punjab, Fractured Balochistan and PTI gaining total victories in KPK while also controlling Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir from early elections.",

The race was held in Darlington, South Carolina at Darlington Raceway, a 1.366 miles (2.198 km) permanent asphalt egg-shaped speedway. The race was originally scheduled to be contested over 147 laps, but was increased to 150 laps due to a NASCAR overtime finish. In a wild and action packed race, Ross Chastain, driving for Niece Motorsports, would steal the win after taking the lead on the final restart, and held off a fast charging field to earn his fifth career NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series win, and his first of the season. Corey Heim, who started second, was the most dominant driver of the race, winning both stages and leading a race-high 77 laps, but finished 28th after being involved in a late race incident. To fill out the podium, Nick Sanchez, driving for Rev Racing, and Ben Rhodes, driving for ThorSport Racing, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nDarlington Raceway is a race track built for NASCAR racing located near Darlington, South Carolina. It is nicknamed \"The Lady in Black\" and \"The Track Too Tough to Tame\" by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as \"A NASCAR Tradition.\" It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends.",

The race was held on Saturday, May 11, 2024, in Darlington, South Carolina at Darlington Raceway, a 1.366 miles (2.198 km) permanent asphalt egg-shaped speedway. The race took the scheduled 147 laps to complete. Justin Allgaier, driving for JR Motorsports, would put on a blistering performance, winning both stages and leading a race-high 119 laps to earn his 24th career NASCAR Xfinity Series win, and his first of the season. With his win, he ties with Dale Earnhardt Jr. for the 10th most wins in Xfinity Series history. To fill out the podium, Austin Hill, driving for Richard Childress Racing, and Cole Custer, driving for Stewart–Haas Racing, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nDarlington Raceway is a race track built for NASCAR racing located near Darlington, South Carolina. It is nicknamed \"The Lady in Black\" and \"The Track Too Tough to Tame\" by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as \"A NASCAR Tradition.\" It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends.",

The government blames the U.S. embargo, which it refers to as a \"blockade\", imposed since the arrival of the Communist Party to power. Cuba accused the U.S. of stirring up unrest, an accusation the United States has denied.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 12 January 2021, then-U.S. President Donald Trump added Cuba to the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, implementing a new series of economic sanctions on the country. The government of Cuba had hoped that Joe Biden would remove Cuba from the list. However, Biden has entirely avoided the issue and, according to Cuban governmental sources, has not responded to several calls to have a diplomatic meeting to remove Cuba from the list.\nIn a press release shortly after the start of the protests, the Cuban government called the inclusion of Cuba on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list to be the most egregious element of U.S. sanctions. U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro (D-TX20) called Biden's failure to remove Cuba from the list \"a serious missed opportunity that has worsened the lives of everyday Cubans.\" By being labeled a State Sponsor of Terrorism, new economic sanctions where implemented that discouraged third-party foreign investment, as those companies would be barred from doing business in the United States under the Helms–Burton Act. Additionally, the inclusion on the list has all but eliminated tourism to Cuba, namely from the European Union.",

While Biden had repeatedly expressed his intent to run for re-election since 2021, there was speculation in the first two years of his presidency that he might not seek re-election due to his age and low approval ratings. After Democrats outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterm elections, many believed the chances that Biden would run for and win his party's nomination had increased, and on April 25, 2023, Biden announced that he would be running for re-election. As of January 2024, Biden maintains a significant lead in primary polling, and no incumbent president in modern history has lost renomination. \nDespite Biden's announcement, several candidates opted to challenge Biden in the primary election. Author Marianne Williamson declared her candidacy in March 2023, which was followed by attorney and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in April and Representative Dean Phillips in October.",

    "2024 Ecuadorian conflict": "On 9 January 2024, an armed conflict broke out in Ecuador involving the country's government against several organized crime groups, most notably the Los Choneros cartel.\nReports of armed attacks throughout Guayaquil and other parts of the country were widespread, occurring primarily in prisons, markets, roads, and universities. The large-scale attacks were a combination of responses to the escape of Los Choneros leader José Adolfo Macías Villamar in Guayaquil, and President Daniel Noboa declaring a state of emergency and then an internal state of war.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe homicide rate in Ecuador rose from 5 to 46 per 100,000 inhabitants between 2017 and 2023. According to political analyst Fernando Carrion, from the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences, the turning point came when Lenín Moreno came into office in 2017. The new president embarked on a policy of austerity and the security apparatus was weakened by merging several ministries into a single one with a reduced budget. Expenditure on prison security was slashed by a third between 2017 and 2021, despite an increase in the prison population.\nThe deterioration in social indicators has also made it easier for gangs to recruit. While the poverty rate had fallen from 35% to 21% between 2007 and 2017, the combined effects of a reduction in public spending under the presidencies of Moreno and Guillermo Lasso and the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed it back up to 27% in 2023. Unemployment and the lack of study grants mean that a third of young people aged between 15 and 25, mostly from disadvantaged backgrounds, are neither studying nor working, making them vulnerable to recruitment by criminal groups.",
