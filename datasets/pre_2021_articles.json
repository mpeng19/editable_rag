    "\"Agathis\" jurassica": "\"Agathis\" jurassica is an extinct coniferous tree found in the Talbragar Fish Beds of New South Wales. The beds were discovered in 1889 near the Farrs Hills in the Talbragar River valley. Specimens from the area were briefly examined by Australian palaeontologists upon discovery and published by R. Etheridge Jr. later that year. The initial classification identified Agathis jurassica as Podozamites lanceolatus. This name was upheld through further inspections by Walkom in 1921, but the species was reclassified as Agathis jurassica in 1981 by Mary White. In 1999, placement in Agathis was doubted, and the species has been referred to as Podozamites jurassica. The species is found predominantly in the Southern Hemisphere with marginal expanses into the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Leaves ===\nLanced leaves, between 4–7 cm in length, between .5-.75 cm in width\nSpiral phyllotaxy\nParallel venation\nbetween 5-8 veins per leaf\nSwollen stem bases with scale leaves\nFoliage spur branchlets\n\n\n=== Cones ===\nCylindrical cone with sub-triangular bract scales\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was originally classified as Podozamites lanceolatus, after a very brief inspection of over one thousand specimens originally collected from the site.

She never recorded, just travelled everywhere to spread the gospel.\" Deborah Williams related to author John Broven, \"I think my grandmother influenced John the most because my mother, Mary Marks, said that my grandmother told my father, 'You are meant to sing', and she didn't want him to have a regular job – she didn't want him to do anything but just that.",

What did slaves eat? ... What clothing did Washington provide? ... On the much debated question of whether African elements survived in slave culture, Thompson acknowledges that the evidence is scanty but cautiously suggests that some naming practices, religious beliefs and methods of food preparation reflect an African inheritance....",

    "\"Welcome to the LBJ Ranch!\"": "\"Welcome to the LBJ Ranch!\"  is a political satire comedy album by Earle Doud and Alen Robin, released in November 1965 on Capitol Records. The vinyl album uses out-of-context recordings of political figures apparently responding to interview questions fabricated by the comedians. Television comedy writers Earle Doud and Alen Robin conduct some of the \"interviews\"; other interviewers are news announcers John Cameron Swayze and Westbrook Van Voorhis, with WPIX anchorman John St. Leger, all of whom were recorded speaking questions written by Doud and Robin. Audio tape was edited to bring together the comedy questions and the recordings of political people, with laugh track sound effects added by Bob Prescott.\nProduced by Robin and Doud, the album was Doud's followup to the massively popular The First Family comedy album of 1962, featuring Vaughn Meader voicing impressions of John F.

    "\"What! Still Alive?!\"": "\"What! Still Alive?!\": Jewish Survivors in Poland and Israel Remember Homecoming is a 2017 book by historian Monika Rice that deals with the memories of Jewish Holocaust survivors of their first encounters with ethnic Poles after liberation from Nazi German rule. The testimonies were all found in archives at Yad Vashem and the Jewish Historical Institute in Poland. \nThe Polish testimonies were collected between 1944 and 1950, while the Israeli ones were created significantly later (from 1955 to 1970). There are significant differences between these testimonies based on the context that they were made in; Rice hypothesizes that in Israel, survivors may have recounted events in such a way as to justify their emigration. The book describes a \"disturbing narrative of violence, hostility, and indifference\" towards survivors, according to Polish-American historian Anna Cichopek-Gajraj.   \nIn her review of the book, published in The Polish Review, Irena Grudzińska-Gross noted that, as stated in the book, the reaction of disbelief was only found in one of the testimonies. She also wrote that in the testimonies used by Rice, the war overshadowed the postwar encounters, but Rice did a good job sorting them out.\nWriting in Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Gordon J. Horwitz called the book \"perceptive and closely argued\" and a \"carefully researched analytical study\". He also praised it for dealing sensitively with the testimonies that comprise its source material.",

The song begs for a different world, with less selfish people.\n\n\n== History and structure ==\nRusso struggled to match the lyrics to the music. Over ten different recordings were attempted.

An example is the opening verse \"Well you know sometimes it gets so hard/And everything don't seem to rhyme/I take a walk out in my backyard and go/Do do loo do do, do do loo, do do.\"  The lyrics show country music influences with references to love, weather and being outdoors.  In reviewing Tupelo Honey, Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau suggested that \"(Straight to Your Heart) Like a Cannonball\" \"transmutes the expression of generalized need for excitement and fulfillment on [the previous song and hit single] \"Wild, Wild Night\" into an expression of desire for a single person.\"\nThe music is lively with a triple metre time signature.  The feel of the music shows jazz and R&B influences.  Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn suggested that it as an \"uptempo spirit.\"  Producer Ted Templeman felt that Ronnie Montrose's electric guitar playing was particularly effective on this song, stating that his \"infectious strummimg and catchy fills made 'Cannonball' worthy of release as a single.\"  Templeman also praised the 2-note hook Montrose played after the \"Do do loo do do, do do loo, do do\" line that ends most of the verses.  Templeman felt that \"it was a simple lick that any guitarist could have played but the way he played was special.  It brightened the tune right up and gave it this pop sheen.\"  Morrison played acoustic guitar on the song.

Presented without a narrator, the audience is left to make up their own minds about the information presented.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewers give credit to the series for exposing some of the worst abuse of the wellness industry. However, the series suffers from false balance, drowning the advice of experts in lengthy testimonies by sympathetic practitioners of alternative medicine and their clients.\nAt CNN, Brian Lowry points to the interviews with scientists and journalists sprinkled through the episodes as an explanation of how people can be manipulated by those who seek to sell treatments \"more rooted in faith than science\". It's also a commentary on the poor state of the healthcare system, with people looking for quick fixes elsewhere.

It has a creamy, cheesy, fatty flavour with slight floral undertones in small concentrations, but contributes towards the strong, musky smell of a few species of antelope and deer in higher concentrations.\n\n\n== Function ==\n(Z)-6-Dodecen-4-olide is believed to play a part in olfactory communication between individuals of the Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), and is secreted into urine during a rut. (Z)-6-Dodecen-4-olide is then deposited onto the tuft of hair making up the tarsal gland of the deer, as the urine runs down the gland, during a behavior called rub-urination. Similarly, it has also been identified in secretions of the interdigital and pedal glands of the bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus) and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) where it is believed to play a role in carrying information about the dominance status, sex, health condition and possibly other characteristics of the animal it came from. The (Z)-6-dodecen-4-olide is replenished daily to maintain the pungent smell. It has also been isolated from Polianthes tuberosa, a perennial plant used in the perfume industry since the 17th century for its powerful floral scent.",

    "*Kóryos": "The kóryos (Proto-Indo-European: 'army, people under arms' or 'detachment, war party') refers to the theoretical Proto-Indo-European brotherhood of warriors in which unmarried young males served for several years, as a rite of passage into manhood, before their full integration into society.\nScholars have theorized the existence of the kóryos based on later Indo-European traditions and myths that feature links between landless young males, perceived as an age-class not yet fully integrated into the community of the married men; their service in a \"police-army\" sent away for part of the year in the wild (where they hunted animals and raided foreign communities), then defending the host society for the rest of the year; their mystical self-identification with wolves and dogs as symbols of death, lawlessness, and warrior fury; and the idea of a liminality between invulnerability and death on one side, and youth and adulthood on the other side.\n\n\n== Etymology and name ==\nThe hypothetical Proto-Indo-European noun *kóryos denotes a 'people under arms' and has been translated as 'army, war-band, unit of warriors', or as 'detachment, war party'. It stems from the noun *kóro- 'cutting, section, division', attested in Old Persian as kāra 'people, army' (Persian: کاروان, romanized: Kārāvan, lit. 'Troupe') and in Lithuanian as kãras 'war, army'.\nThe term *kóryos has descendant cognates in the Baltic *kāryas 'army', Celtic *koryos 'troop, tribe', and Germanic *harjaz 'host, troop, army, raiding-party'. In west-central Indo-European dialects, the designation *koryonos, meaning 'leader of the *kóryos' (here attached to the suffix -nos 'master of'), is also attested: Ancient Greek koíranos 'army-leader', Old Norse Herjan (< PGmc *harjanaz 'army-leader'), and Brittonic Coriono-totae 'people of the army-leader'.\nThe Gallic tribes Uo-corri ('two-armies'), Tri-corii ('three-armies') and Petru-corii ('four-armies') were presumably formed from alliances of roving war-bands. The noun *harja- is also part of compound names in Germanic languages, such as Herigast (Heregast), possibly attested as Harikast on the Negau helmet. Some toponyms in Western Europe, such as Cherbourg in France or Heerlen in the Netherlands, may stem from historical ethnic groups whose name contained the Celtic noun *koryo- 'army, troop', as proposed by Pierre-Yves Lambert.\nAdditionally, the Asturian personal name Vacoria (similar to Gaulish Vocorius) has been interpreted as stemming from the Celtic ethnic name *(d)uo-korio 'possessing two armies', and the Gallic tribal name Coriosolites as meaning 'those who watch over the troop', or 'those who purchase soldiers or mercenaries'.",

    ".22 ILARCO": "The .22 ILARCO, also known as the .22 Winchester Short Magnum Rimfire or .22 American, was a rimfire cartridge designed in 1987 for the American-180 rimfire submachine gun. At the time the cartridge was created, the design of the American-180 had been taken over by the Illinois Arms Company, Inc., hence the ILARCO name.\n\n\n== History ==\nSometime after the Illinois Arms Company, Inc. (ILARCO) purchased the rights to the American-180 they determined a more powerful cartridge would be appropriate, which resulted in the creation of the .22 ILARCO. The new cartridge was designed so that a simple change of barrel was all that was required to switch between standard .22 Long Rifle, for which the gun was designed, and the new cartridge.\n\n\n== Dimensions and loading ==\nThe .22 ILARCO uses a shorter version of the .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire case, which use the same 40 gr (2.6 g) projectile as the original .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire cartridge.",

Its hybrid three-piece cartridge case has a steel case head and brass body connected by an aluminum locking washer to support the high chamber pressure of 80,000 psi (551.6 MPa).\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe cartridge was designed by SIG Sauer for the United States Army's Next Generation Squad Weapon Program (NGSW). It is dimensionally similar to the 7.62×51mm NATO service cartridge.\nIn December 2019, the cartridge was announced for non-military usage, along with the SIG Sauer CROSS bolt-action rifle. As a short-action rifle cartridge (cartridges having an overall length of 2.750 inches (69.85 mm) or less), increased internal ballistic performance for its cartridge case volume is accomplished by applying high gas pressure. In 2020, it was accepted by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI) as a new rifle cartridge and chambering. In 2022, SIG Sauer announced that it intends to commercially chamber the SIG MCX Spear semi-automatic rifle in .277 Fury.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe cartridge uses a case that is the same length and diameter as the .308 Winchester. Each \"hybrid\" cartridge case consists of a stainless steel base coupled to a brass body via an aluminium locking washer.",

    ".460 Steyr": "The .460 Steyr (11.6×90mm Grillmayer) is a center fire cartridge from the weapons manufacturer Steyr Mannlicher, which was developed for sniper rifles. During the development, important features for the military, such as the penetration power of armor or a tracer, were not taken into account. The cartridge was presented for the first time in February 2004 at the ShotShow-2004 in Las Vegas together with the Steyr HS .50.\nThe cartridge was designed by Horst Grillmayer in 2002, while the projectile was designed by Guido Wasser. Production started around 2004 together with the Steyr HS .460.\nThe ammunition was developed for precision rifles for sport shooters, with the focus on the long range and bypassing the 12.7 × 99 mm NATO (.50 BMG) caliber, the use of which is prohibited in many European countries for non-official purposes. The ammunition can also be of interest to armies deployed abroad, which have been banned from using 12.7 mm ammunition in peacekeeping operations.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe external shape of the .460 Steyr cartridge is very similar to cartridges in the 12.7 × 99 mm caliber, but has a shorter case and a narrower cartridge neck, which leads to increased gas pressure. The ballistic properties of the .460 Steyr and the 12.7 × 99 mm are largely similar.\nThe ammunition is also comparable to other special cartridges such as the .408 Chey Tac or the .416 Barrett, which were also developed as special calibers for precision rifles in order to be able to work over long distances.",

Containing 100 to 120 grains of Hodgdon 888 black-powder substitute and neither a primer nor a bullet, the round and the rifle designed for it were devised as a way of creating a gun that functions as closely to a modern rifle as possible whilst still being legal in muzzleloader hunting season.\nBeing supplied with neither a primer nor a projectile, the Federal FireStick blank round can be used as a live-fire cartridge by first inserting a primer manually into the rimmed base, then placing it into the breech of the Traditions NitroFire, much like a traditional shotshell in a break-action shotgun. Finally, a .50 calibre bullet is pushed down the barrel from the front using a ramrod, coming to rest at a narrowed neck that separates the slug from the charge and prevents the user from attempting to fire incompatible ammunition.",

Events are most commonly shot at 100 meters, but sometimes 80 meters instead (particularly in Sweden). The use of electronic targets is common, but cardboard targets are also sometimes used.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1950s, many shooting ranges in Norway had already been set up for training on running moose targets, but it was first introduced as a competition in the 1960s by the Norwegian Association of Hunters and Anglers. Interest increased steadily, and in the 1980s over 130 shooting ranges across Norway were set up for running moose. In Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane in Western Norway, it was for long common to change the running moose targets with one of a running deer with the same hit zones and points, since there is little moose and a lot of red deer in those regions. Nowadays, most ranges have changed to standard moose targets.\n\n\n== Program ==\nA match consists of 20 fired rounds. The first 10 rounds are shot at a static target, while the last 10 rounds are fired at a moving target.",

    "10 sen note": "The 10 sen note (十銭紙幣) was a denomination of Japanese yen issued in four different series from 1872 to 1947 for use in commerce. Meiji Tsūhō notes are the first modern banknotes issued after Japanese officials studied western culture. There circulated alongside ten sen coins until their withdrawal in 1887. The other three series of ten sen notes issued are in some way tied to the impacts of World War I and World War II. Taishō fractional ten sen notes were issued as a response to a coin shortage that was caused by the first of these wars. They were eventually suspended in the early 1920s when things had settled down, and were later demonetized in 1948. The last two series of ten sen notes were issued by the Bank of Japan rather than the treasury. First series notes were issued as ten sen coins could no longer be produced, while the A series was released after the war in a futile attempt to curb inflation. These last two issues were demonetized at the end of 1953 when the Japanese government passed a law abolishing subsidiary notes in favor of the yen. Ten sen notes are now bought and sold as collectors items depending on condition.\n\n\n== Government currency ==\n\n\n=== Meiji Tsūhō (1872) ===\n\nThe first ten sen notes adopted and released by the Japanese government are part of a series known as Meiji Tsūhō (明治通宝).",

They served through the First World War, with one of the ships, Tb 11, defecting to Italy in 1917.

By 1907, these had been refined to a single design, oil-fuelled but powered by a triple expansion engine as the designers had insufficient experience with turbines. This local design was compared with designs from the German shipyards Schichau-Werke and Krupp and the British shipyard Yarrow and was considered to be superior to the foreign designs.\nIt was initially planned for Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) to build eight ships at their Trieste shipyard, but it was required for political reasons that the work be divided between Austrian and Hungarian shipyards, and in the end six ships were built each at the Austrian STT shipyard and the Hungarian Ganz & Danubius yard at Fiume, with each shipbuilder building slightly different designs, with the Ganz & Danubius-built ships having different machinery in order to increase the Hungarian content in the ships.\nThe STT-built ships were 44.2 m (145 ft 0 in) long overall and 43.3 m (142 ft 1 in) at the waterline, with a beam of 4.4 m (14 ft 5 in) and a draught of 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in).

After suffering heavy casualties, it broke down into separate units while continuing to fight in the Battle of the Caucasus. It was disbanded on 27 January 1943, after the Soviet Union began to dissolve national divisions. Unsubstantiated rumors surrounding its alleged misconduct during the war contributed to the decision to deport Kalmyks to Siberia.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nDuring the early stages of the German invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, the latter suffered massive casualties. Over one hundred Soviet divisions were disbanded due to losses in manpower.

The 1139th Engineer Combat Group fought from northern France to Austria in World War II, supporting General George Patton's Third Army's rapid movements during the war.\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group is credited with opening routes for the advancement of troops which included building 119 tactical bridges, of which 39 were 200 feet or longer, including the 1,896 foot \"longest floating tactical bridge constructed in the European Theater of Operations.\" The Group was first formed in December 1943 and deactivated in December 1946.\n\n\n== Development of the Engineer Combat Group Concept ==\nStarting with WWII, the United States Army defined a \"group\" to be similar in concept to a regiment, the unit type from which the group was evolved. In general, a regiment is composed of a fixed number of assigned battalions, whose personnel and equipment are likewise fixed. The battalions have only the minimum administrative personnel, with the result that administrative details are handled by the regimental headquarters.  In warfare as mobile and on as vast a scale as the European campaign was, it was felt regiments were sometimes not sufficiently agile for achieving maximum effectiveness. Therefore, the group was designed as a flexible organization set up to efficiently meet rapidly changing tactical requirements. The group would consist of a small headquarters and a varying number of separate companies and battalions which could be attached to and detached from the group headquarters as the situation demanded.\nThe Engineer Combat Group had many duties: construction, repair and dismantling of various bridge types; clearing of obstacles; road repair and construction; ferrying troops in river crossings; laying smoke screens; detecting, removing, and laying of mines and demolitions, in addition to offensive and defensive infantry functions.",

    "1152 imperial election": "Frederick Barbarossa was elected King of Germany on 4 March 1152 in Frankfurt am Main. Frederick's uncle, Otto of Freising, was an eyewitness and is the most important source for the 1152 election. According to him, \"the entire company of the princes ... from the immense extent of the transalpine realm (as well as certain barons from Italy)\" met in Frankfurt by early March to elect a successor to King Conrad III, who had died barely two weeks earlier at Bamberg on 15 February 1152. Only five days after his election, on 9 March, Frederick was crowned in the Aachen Chapel.\nThe apparent quickness of the election of 1152 contrasts with those of 1125 and 1138. In his own letter to Otto of Freising listing the accomplishments of his first five years on the throne, Frederick does not mention his election, but says only that \"we were anointed at Aachen and received the crown of the German realm.\" According to Otto, Conrad had on his deathbed designated Frederick as his choice of successor, because he knew that the princes would not elect his young son, Frederick. He then entrusted his son and the royal insignia to Frederick.\nConrad's designation was not sufficient to make Frederick king or determine his election. This is shown from a diploma—D.38 in Heinrich Appelt's edition of Frederick diplomas—drawn up for Alteburg Abbey during the brief interregnum.",

The battalion assembled in camp at Caernarfon, joining the newly raised 7th, 8th and 9th Battalions of the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) and together they constituted No 15 Infantry Training Group. In October 1940 the 15th ITG became 215th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), a home defence formation.

As early as January 1915, Major Petar Darvingov submitted to the Ministry of War a report on the use of the Macedonian-Adrianople Volunteer Corps, in which he argued that the re-formation of the militia could be necessary and justified mainly if it was given the task of occupying the region of Macedonia. The order to establish the 11th Division was issued on August 22, 1915. It was formed from September 1 to 4 by a special staff during the general mobilisation of the active Bulgarian army in September, just before Bulgaria's intervention in the First World War. It consisted from Bulgarians from Macedonia - refugee volunteers who did not serve in the Bulgarian army and deserters from the Serbian and Greek armies.

    "11β-Chloromethylestradiol": "11β-Chloromethylestradiol (11β-CME2; developmental code name ORG-4333) is a synthetic steroidal estrogen which was never marketed. It has very high affinity for the estrogen receptor and dissociates from it relatively slowly. It was originally thought that 11β-CME2 might be a covalent ligand of the estrogen receptors, but its binding was subsequently shown to be fully reversible. The relative binding affinity of 11β-CME2 for the estrogen receptors ranges from 230 to 3,320% of that of estradiol depending on the study. 11β-CME2 also has about 14% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).

    "12-pounder Whitworth rifle": "The 12-pounder Whitworth rifle was a medium caliber field gun deployed during the mid-19th century. Designed by Joseph Whitworth, the gun was most notably used during the American Civil War. The gun was also used by the Imperial Brazilian Army in the War of the Triple Alliance.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe 12-pdr rifle was designed  in the early 1850s by British manufacturer Joseph Whitworth, who had recently been contracted to improve the Pattern 1853 Enfield. During his experiments with the Enfield, Whitworth was inspired to begin experimenting with a hexagonally-rifled barrel; Whitworth would later apply these principles to his field guns.\nAlong with Whitworth's smaller 3-pdr gun, the artillery piece was considered for adoption by the British government's Board of Ordnance. However, Whitworth's guns eventually lost out to the Armstrong gun. During the American Civil War the weapon was exported and saw service in the Union and Confederate armies, though it was considered a rarity.\nFrom a design standpoint, the weapon was unique. Like all of Whitworth's designs, the weapon had a distinctive hexagon-ally rifled barrel and was a breechloader (though it could be loaded via the muzzle with modifications).",

The song features guest vocals by rapper 21 Savage, American singer-songwriter Atia \"Ink\" Boggs, and American musician Kadhja Bonet. It was written by the artists and DJ Dahi who produced it with Gambino.\nGlover sings about a psilocybin-induced trip with a girl, while 21 Savage raps about police harassment.

    "120×570mm NATO": "120×570mm NATO tank ammunition (4.7 inch), also known as 120×570mmR, is a common, NATO-standard (STANAG 4385), tank gun semi-combustible cartridge used by 120mm smoothbore guns, superseding the earlier 105×617mmR cartridge used in NATO-standard rifled tank guns.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe 120×570 R cartridge was originally intended for the German Rh-120 smoothbore gun but an interoperability agreement signed between West Germany and France in April 1979, followed in September 1981 by a project to install the M256 120 mm smoothbore gun on future M1A1 Abrams tanks made it a NATO standard.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe 120×570mm are one-piece ammunition with semi-combustible cartridge cases. These incorporate a short, metallic stub case with an elastomeric sealing ring which allows the use of a normal sliding wedge type of breech and at the same time significantly reduces the weight of the rounds. Thus, a round of 120 mm Rheinmetall APFSDS ammunition has a mass of 19.8 kg, which is little more than the 18 kg mass of a typical 105 mm APFSDS round with the traditional metallic cartridge case.\n\n\n== Ammunition ==\n\n\n=== Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) ===\n\nThere are different ways to measure APFSDS penetration value. NATO uses the 50% (This means that 50% of the shell had to go through the plate), while the Soviet/Russian standard is higher (80% had to go through).",

This plan was modified and in the final version received by district commander Colonel General Dmitry Pavlov on 9 June in a directive of the People's Commissar of Defense, the 121st was instead assigned to the 24th Rifle Corps in the second echelon of the 3rd Army, which was deployed along the line of Vidzy, Sventyany and the Viliya River.",

    "128th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery": "The 128th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment (128th LAA Rgt) was an air defence unit of Britain's Royal Artillery during World War II. The regiment was formed in March 1942 from the short-lived 87th Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery, which had only been raised in the previous year as part of the rapid expansion of Anti-Aircraft (AA) defences. It served in AA Command until near the end of the war, when it was converted into an infantry battalion for garrison duties in North West Europe.\n\n\n== 87th Searchlight Regiment, RA ==\n\n87th Searchlight Regiment (87th S/L Rgt) was created during the rapid expansion of AA defences during The Blitz. Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) was formed at Burnley in Lancashire on 23 January 1941 and it was allocated four S/L batteries numbered 529, 532, 533 and 534. The batteries came from different training regiments, where each had been formed on 14 November around a cadre of experienced men drawn from an existing S/L regiment:\n\n529 S/L Bty, formed by 234th S/L Training Rgt at Carlisle, cadre from 71st (East Lancashire) S/L Rgt\n532 S/L Bty, formed by 236th S/L Training Rgt at Oswestry, cadre from 34th (Queen's Own Royal West Kent) S/L Rgt\n533 S/L Bty, formed by 236th S/L Training Rgt, cadre from 73rd (Kent Fortress) S/L Rgt\n534 S/L Bty, formed by 237th S/L Training Rgt at Holywood, Northern Ireland, cadre from 3rd (Ulster) S/L Rgt\nAfter training, the regiment was assigned to 53rd Light AA Brigade, commanding the S/L units of 4th AA Division across the North Midlands. The night Blitz was coming to an end, but Luftwaffe raids continued to overfly en route to Merseyside, including seven nights in May (the Liverpool Blitz), and Nottingham was raided on the night of 8/9 May (the Nottingham Blitz).\n\nThe role of the S/L units was to track and illuminate raiders for the Heavy AA (HAA) guns of the Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) and for the few available Royal Air Force (RAF) night fighters. In November 1940 AA Command had adopted a system of clustering three S/Ls together to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced 10,400 yards (9,500 m) apart. This layout was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with Searchlight Control radar (SLC) and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.",

    "12 Step foot controller": "The 12 Step foot controller is a bass pedal-style programmable MIDI controller pedal keyboard made by Keith McMillen Instruments which was released in 2011. It has small, soft, rubbery keys that are played with the feet. As a MIDI controller, it does not make or output any musical sounds by itself; rather, it sends MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) messages about which notes are played (and with which types of expression or pressure) to an external synth module or computer music program running on a laptop or other computer. Each key on the 12 Step senses the velocity, aftertouch pressure, and the amount of tilt the player is applying with his feet. The messages from the player's foot presses can be sent via USB to a computer-based virtual instrument or to a  synthesizer or other electronic or digital musical instrument.\nThe expressive nuances in playing the 12 Step can be used to make a virtual instrument or synthesizer's melodic line change in sound or timbre. For example, a melody line could be played to get louder and softer by pressing the keys harder or more gently; by continuing to hold down a long note, the player could trigger effects on the synth patch such as vibrato; and by tilting the foot on the key, they could trigger a pitch bend (depending on the user's programming of the 12 Step and the design of the synth patch). The 12 Step's keys can be used to play individual notes in many octaves, enabling it to be used to play anything from deep-pitched basslines or high-pitched melody lines.\nAs well, the keys on the 12 step can be programmed to play chords of up to five unique notes per rubbery key (e.g., the C note can be programmed to play a C major chord, the D note can be programmed to play a \"d minor\" chord, and so on). The programmable chord feature enables performers to play chords with their feet and accompany themselves or be a one man band.",

It served in Home Defence throughout the war, until disbandment in 1945.\n\n\n== 85th Searchlight Regiment ==\nThe regiment was formed during the rapid expansion of anti-aircraft (AA) defences during the Blitz of 1940–41. Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) was formed on 23 January 1941 at 35th Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA)  Regiment's RHQ at Black Hall on St Giles', Oxford.

By the time it came into existence the Blitz was ending. During this campaign AA Command had adopted a S/L layout of clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced 10,400 yards (9,500 m) apart. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with Searchlight Control radar (SLC or 'Elsie') and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply. 64th AA Brigade's batteries were deployed in three-light clusters at Royal Air Force (RAF) airfields, and had begun to receive GL Mark I E/F gun-laying radar equipped with elevation-finding equipment.",

He preached a sermon against Louis in which he quoted from Ambrose's letter to the Emperor Valentinian II: \"What could be more honourable to the emperor than to be called a son of the [church]?\" Charles and his father, King John of Bohemia, were in attendance. Afterwards, Charles swore an oath to Clement that if elected he would annul all of his predecessor's acts and not spend more than one day in Rome for his imperial coronation.\nOn 28 April 1346, Clement VI formally requested the electors to elect a new emperor. Two of the electors were Charles's relations: the king of Bohemia was his father and the archbishop of Trier was his great uncle, Baldwin of Luxembourg. A third, the archbishop of Mainz, Gerlach of Nassau, had only been installed after Clement deposed Henry of Virneberg on 7 April 1346. Charles also received the support of Walram of Jülich, archbishop of Cologne, and Rudolf, Duke of Saxony.\nCharles IV was far from having universal support in the Empire while Louis still lived. He was labelled a Pfaffenkönig (parson's king) because of the role the pope played in procuring his election.",

    "13th Light Tank Brigade": "The 13th Light Tank Brigade (Russian: 13-я лёгкая танковая бригада (13 лтбр)) was an armored brigade of the Red Army that fought in the Winter War. It was formed as the 31st Uritsky Mechanized Brigade in 1932 at Stary Petergof near Leningrad, assigned to the 11th Mechanized Corps, one of the first armored units of the Red Army. Two years later, the brigade became part of the new 7th Mechanized Corps, and it sent crews to fight in the Spanish Civil War. When the corps was redesignated as the 10th Tank Corps, the brigade became the 13th Light Tank Brigade in 1938. In late 1939, it and the corps participated in the massing of forces on the Estonian and Latvian borders to force their governments to agree to Soviet demands. \nAfter Finland refused Soviet demands to cede territory, the brigade and its parent corps were committed to the invasion that began the Winter War. An ambitious plan for the employment of the 10th Tank Corps to encircle Finnish troops in the Karelian Isthmus at the beginning of the war in December quickly failed due to the unexpected strength of Finnish anti-tank defenses, and instead it was tasked with exploiting an anticipated infantry breakthrough in the Battle of Summa. This did not materialize, although the brigade lost several tanks to Finnish artillery while waiting to go into action. It was withdrawn from combat and served as an independent unit from late December, training intensively for the breakthrough of the Mannerheim Line. When Soviet infantry assaults supported by other tank units accomplished the latter in mid-February 1940, the brigade was sent into the breach.",

In early April 1863, Captain Robert C. Wood, aide-de-camp to Confederate Major General Sterling Price, was detached to form an artillery unit from some of the men of Price's escort.  Wood continued recruiting for the unit, which was armed with four Williams guns, and grew to 275 men by the end of September.  The next month, the unit fought in the Battle of Pine Bluff, driving back Union Army troops into a barricaded defensive position, from which the Union soldiers could not be dislodged.  By November, the unit, which was known as Wood's Missouri Cavalry Battalion, had grown to 400 men but no longer had the Williams guns.  In April 1864, Wood's battalion, which was also known as the 14th Missouri Cavalry Battalion, played a minor role in the defeat of a Union foraging party in the Battle of Poison Spring, before spending the summer of 1864 at Princeton, Arkansas.  In September, the unit joined Price's Raid into the state of Missouri, but their assault during the Battle of Pilot Knob failed to capture Fort Davidson.\nWood's battalion fought at the Battle of Little Blue River on October 21 after having participated in some further fighting and operationed against railroads.

It fired a 14 lb (6.4 kg) solid shot up to a distance of 1,530 yd (1,400 m) at 5° elevation. It could also fire canister shot and common shell. Shortly before the war broke out, the U.S. Army adopted a plan to convert M1841 6-pounder field guns from smoothbore to rifled artillery. Rifling the existing 6-pounders would both improve the gun's accuracy and increase the weight of the shell (by elongating the round). There were two major types produced, both were bronze with a bore (caliber) of 3.8 in (97 mm) that would accommodate ammunition designed by Charles Tillinghast James. The first type looked exactly like an M1841 6-pounder field gun. The second type had a longer tube with a smooth exterior profile similar to a 3-inch Ordnance rifle. At first the rifles were quite accurate. However, it was discovered that the bronze rifling quickly wore out and accuracy declined.",

    "1434 oath": "The 1434 oath was taken by members of the English gentry and swore them to refrain from harbouring law-breakers and other breakers of the King's Peace.\n\n\n== The oath ==\nIn 1434 the King, Henry VI, was still a legal minor, and the royal council ruled on his behalf. Aware of the important role the gentry and nobility played in the regions in keeping law and order, the council believed that it would be a positive step for these men to swear an oath \"that they would neither use their wealth and influence to undertake criminal activities nor maintain lesser men\" who did. The nobility had already taken a similar oath in the House of Lords the previous year at the instigation of the Commons, which also took the oath on the same day. It was then decided that all major landholders in the country should also swear the same.\nThe oath instructed that all who took it would not:\n\nReceyve, cheryssh, hold in houshold ne maigtene pillours, robbours, oppressours of the peple, mansleers, felons, owtlawes, ravissheres of wommen, brekers of parkes or warennes, or eny other open mysdoor or eny openly named or famed for such till his innocencie be declared, and that no man take eny other mennes cause or querell in favour or meyntenaunce as be word, by writyng or message to officer, juge, jure or partie be colour of eny feffement.\nOn 20 January the parliament's Knights of the Shire were instructed to compose and submit to Chancery a list of those property holders who qualified in their constituencies.

    "143rd (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery": "143rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment was an air defence unit of Britain's Royal Artillery formed during World War II. It started out as a 'Mixed' regiment with around two-thirds of its personnel being women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The regiment defended the West of England from 1942 to the end of the war when it moved to South East England. The regiment continued (as an all-male unit) in the postwar British Army.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\n\nBy 1941, after two years of war Anti-Aircraft Command, tasked with defending the UK against air attack, was suffering a manpower shortage. In April its commander-in-chief, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile, proposed to overcome this by utilising the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The ATS was by law a non-combatant service, but it was decided that Defence Regulations permitted the employment of women in anti-aircraft (AA) roles other than actually firing the guns. They worked the radar and plotting instruments, range-finders and predictors, ran command posts and communications, and carried out many other duties. With the increasing automation of heavy AA (HAA) guns, including gun-laying, fuze-setting and ammunition loading under remote control from the predictor, the question of who actually fired the gun became blurred as the war progressed. The ATS rank and file, if not always their officers, took to the new role with enthusiasm and 'Mixed' batteries and regiments with the ATS supplying two-thirds of their personnel quickly proved a success.\n\nBy late 1941 the training regiments were turning out a regular stream of Mixed HAA batteries, which AA Command formed into regiments to take the place of the all-male units being sent to overseas theatres of war.",

    "14 regions of Constantinople": "The ancient city of Constantinople was divided into 14 administrative regions (Latin: regiones). The system of fourteen regiones was modelled on the fourteen regiones of Rome, a system introduced by the first Roman emperor Augustus in the 1st century AD.\nAfter Emperor Constantine the Great re-founded Byzantium as Constantinople and Nova Roma ('New Rome') in the early 4th century, he or his immediate successors divided Constantinople into its own 14 regiones. Each region (regio) was numbered, and their boundaries and landmarks in the 5th century were enumerated by the Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae, which also gives details of the city's Cura Annonae, the public grain ration which was distributed by regio. Two regiones, XIII and XIV, were outside the original city walls.\n\n\n== The 14 regions ==\n\n\n=== Regio I ===\nThe area of the Ist regio was defined by the Great Palace, which lay within it, the southeastern edge of Hippodrome, the Byzantine acropolis, and the sea (the Propontis). Here, besides the Great Palace, there were a number of palatial buildings named by the Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae: there was the Palace of Placidia, (Palatium Placidianum) connected with a daughter of Valentinian I, and a House of Galla Placidia (Domus Placidiae Augustae), associated with the augusta Galla Placidia, daughter of Theodosius I and husband of first Athaulf and then Constantius III. A House of the Nobilissima Marina (Domum nobilissimae Marinae) was probably named for Marina, a daughter of Galla Placidia's brother Arcadius augustus, who himself gave his name to the Baths of Arcadius, (Thermas Arcadianas) described by Procopius.\n\n\n=== Regio II ===\nThe IInd regio was the site of Hagia Sophia and Hagia Irene, which the Notitia calls the Magna Ecclesia, 'Great Church' and the Ecclesia Antiqua, 'Old Church', a court-house, and the huge Baths of Zeuxippus. These thermae were on the southern side of the Augustaion square and extended as far as the northern edge of the Hippodrome and the Great Palace. On the eastern edge of the Augustaion beside Hagia Sophia was a senate-house for the Byzantine Senate, (to be distinguished from the senate-house in the Forum of Constantine) which is mentioned in the Chronicon Paschale and by Procopius, who called it a bouleuterion (Ancient Greek: βουλευτήριον). Though the IInd regio encompassed buildings on three of the Augustaion's four sides, the square itself was counted in the IVth regio.",

    "15-minute city": "The 15-minute city (FMC or 15mC) is an urban planning concept in which most daily necessities and services, such as work, shopping, education, healthcare, and leisure can be easily reached by a 15-minute walk, bike ride, or public transit ride from any point in the city. This approach aims to reduce car dependency, promote healthy and sustainable living, and improve wellbeing and quality of life for city dwellers.\nImplementing the 15-minute city concept requires a multi-disciplinary approach, involving transportation planning, urban design, and policymaking, to create well-designed public spaces, pedestrian-friendly streets, and mixed-use development. This change in lifestyle may include remote working which reduces daily commuting and is supported by the recent widespread availability of information and communications technology. The concept has been described as a \"return to a local way of life\".\nThe concept's roots can be traced to pre-modern urban planning traditions where walkability and community living were the primary focus before the advent of street networks and automobiles. In recent times, it builds upon similar pedestrian-centered principles found in New Urbanism, transit-oriented development, and other proposals that promote walkability, mixed-use developments, and compact, livable communities. Numerous models have been proposed about how the concept can be implemented, such as 15-minute cities being built from a series of smaller 5-minute neighborhoods, also known as complete communities or walkable neighborhoods.\nThe concept gained significant traction in recent years after Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo included a plan to implement the 15-minute city concept during her 2020 re-election campaign. Since then, a number of cities worldwide have adopted the same goal and many researchers have used the 15-minute model as a spatial analysis tool to evaluate accessibility levels within the urban fabric.",
    "15.ai": "15.ai is a non-commercial freeware artificial intelligence web application that generates natural emotive high-fidelity text-to-speech voices from an assortment of fictional characters from a variety of media sources. Developed by a pseudonymous MIT researcher under the name 15, the project uses a combination of audio synthesis algorithms, speech synthesis deep neural networks, and sentiment analysis models to generate and serve emotive character voices faster than real-time, particularly those with a very small amount of trainable data.\nLaunched in early 2020, 15.ai began as a proof of concept of the democratization of voice acting and dubbing using technology. Its gratis and non-commercial nature (with the only stipulation being that the project be properly credited when used), ease of use, no user account registration requirement, and substantial improvements to current text-to-speech implementations have been lauded by users; however, some critics and voice actors have questioned the legality and ethicality of leaving such technology publicly available and readily accessible.\nCredited as the impetus behind the popularization of AI voice cloning (also known as audio deepfakes) in content creation and as the first publicly available AI vocal synthesis project to involve the use of existing popular fictional characters, 15.ai has had a significant impact on multiple Internet fandoms, most notably the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, Team Fortress 2, and SpongeBob SquarePants fandoms. Furthermore, 15.ai has inspired the use of 4chan's Pony Preservation Project in other generative artificial intelligence projects.\nSeveral commercial alternatives have spawned with the rising popularity of 15.ai, leading to cases of misattribution and theft. In January 2022, it was discovered that Voiceverse NFT, a company that voice actor Troy Baker announced his partnership with, had plagiarized 15.ai's work as part of their platform.\nOn September 8, 2022, 15.ai was temporarily taken down in preparation for an upcoming update, a year after its last stable release (v24.2.1). As of May 2024, it is still temporarily offline, though the new avatar icon was updated in Twitter.",

It is located at the southeast corner of Spruce Street and Nassau Street, next to 8 Spruce Street, the former New York Times Building, and New York City Hall.\n150 Nassau Street was built in 1894–1895 as the headquarters of the American Tract Society (ATS), a nonprofit, nonsectarian but evangelical organization that distributed religious tracts. Designed by the architect R. H. Robertson, it is one of the first skyscrapers built from a steel skeleton and was among New York City's tallest buildings when it was completed.\n150 Nassau Street is located near Park Row, which contained several newspaper headquarters. The building failed to make a profit during ATS's occupancy, and the New York Life Insurance Company foreclosed on the building in 1914. After ATS moved out, the New York Sun occupied the building from 1914 to 1919. The building's 10th through 23rd floors were converted into condominiums between 1999 and 2002.

    "1510 influenza pandemic": "In 1510, an acute respiratory disease emerged in Asia before spreading through North Africa and Europe during the first chronicled, inter-regional flu pandemic generally recognized by medical historians and epidemiologists. Influenza-like illnesses had been documented in Europe since at least Charlemagne, with 1357's outbreak the first to be called influenza, but the 1510 flu pandemic is the first to be pathologically described following communication advances brought about by the printing press. Flu became more widely referred to as coqueluche and coccolucio in France and Sicily during this pandemic, variations of which became the most popular names for flu in early modern Europe. The pandemic caused significant disruption in government, church, and society with near-universal infection and a mortality rate of around 1%.\n\n\n== Asia ==\nThe 1510 flu is suspected of originating in East Asia, possibly China. Gregor Horst writes in Operum medicorum tombus primus (1661) that the disease came from Asia and spread along trade routes before attacking the Middle East and North Africa. German medical writer Justus Hecker suggested the 1510 influenza most likely came from Asia because of the historical nature of other influenzas to originate there in more recent pandemics.\n\n\n=== Middle East ===\nThe flu spread along trade routes towards North Africa, traveling southwest through the Middle East. Frequently visited cities like Jerusalem and Mecca would have almost certainly been reached by the flu, with large volumes of people destined to travel to Egypt, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\n== Africa ==\nIt is generally understood that the 1510 influenza had spread in Africa before Europe.",
    "1521 Santo Domingo Slave Revolt": "The 1521 Santo Domingo Slave Revolt in the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola took place around the time of Christmas festivities in 1521. It is the earliest recorded slave rebellion in the Americas. Just days after the rebellion, the colonial authorities introduced a set of laws to prevent another uprising. These are thought to be the earliest surviving laws created to control enslaved Africans in the New World. \nThere is some disagreement by historians on the precise date of the rebellion. Some historical sources state the rebellion took place on the first or second day of Christmas. Contemporary historians generally mark the anniversary of the rebellion as December 25th or 26th, other sources mistakenly call it the \"1522 slave rebellion\". \nThe rebellion started on the Nueva Isabela sugar plantation (located today in the northwestern outskirts of Santo Domingo city) owned by the colony's governor Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. The text of 1522 slave laws describe that a \"certain number\" of slaves \"agreed to rebel and rebelled with intention and purpose to kill all the Christians they could and to free themselves and take over the land.\" The historical documents present the uprising as well-planned and coordinated action. Local oral tradition says that the rebellion was led by Maria Olofa (Wolofa) and Gonzalo Mandinga, a romantic couple, both Muslims from the Wolof nation.",

    "1540 European drought": "The 1540 drought in Europe was a climatic event in Europe. In various palaeoclimatic analyses the temperature and precipitation regimes were reconstructed and compared to present-day conditions.\nOn the basis of historical records Wetter et al. (2014) derived that during an eleven-month period there was little rain in Europe, possibly qualifying as a megadrought. These conclusions however were questioned by Büntgen et al. (2015) on the basis of additional data (tree rings).\nOrth et al. (2016) concluded that in summer 1540 the mean temperature was above the 1966–2015 mean and with a probability of 20% exceeded that of the 2003 summer; however, the study's mean reconstruction suggests that the summer of 2003 was still overall hotter across much of Europe.\n\n\n== Scientific evaluation and discussion ==\nThe assumption of a megadrought in the year 1540 is primarily supported by more than 300 contemporary chronicles from across Europe, which consistently describe the effects of prolonged drought and heat, such as a significant precipitation deficit, extremely low levels of major rivers, widespread wildfires, the lowering of groundwater levels (resulting in the drying up of wells), as well as severe consequences for agriculture and livestock farming.

    "1557 influenza pandemic": "In 1557, a pandemic strain of influenza emerged in Asia, then spread to Africa, Europe, and eventually the Americas. This flu was highly infectious and presented with intense, occasionally lethal symptoms. Medical historians like Thomas Short, Lazare Rivière and Charles Creighton gathered descriptions of catarrhal fevers recognized as influenza by modern physicians attacking populations with the greatest intensity between 1557 and 1559. The 1557 flu saw governments, for possibly the first time, inviting physicians to instill bureaucratic organization into epidemic responses. It is also the first pandemic where influenza is pathologically linked to miscarriages, given its first English names, and is reliably recorded as having spread globally. Influenza caused higher burial rates, near-universal infection, and economic turmoil as it returned in repeated waves.\n\n\n== Asia ==\nAccording to a European chronicler surnamed Fonseca who wrote Disputat. de Garotillo, the 1557 influenza pandemic first broke out in Asia. The flu spread west along established trade and pilgrimage routes before reaching the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. An epidemic of a flu-like illness is recorded for September 1557 in Portuguese Goa.",
    "155th (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery": "155th (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment was an air defence unit of Britain's Royal Artillery formed during World War II. Around two-thirds of its personnel were women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). After defending the West of Scotland and later London, the regiment was heavily engaged in Operation Diver against V-1 flying bombs, and later was deployed to Antwerp to carry out anti-Diver duties there in the closing stages of the war.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\n\nBy 1941, after two years of war Anti-Aircraft Command, tasked with defending the UK against air attack, was suffering a manpower shortage. In April its commander-in-chief, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile, proposed to overcome this by utilising the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The ATS was by law a non-combatant service, but it was decided that Defence Regulations permitted the employment of women in anti-aircraft (AA) roles other than actually firing the guns. They worked the radar and plotting instruments, range-finders and predictors, ran command posts and communications, and carried out many other duties. With the increasing automation of heavy AA (HAA) guns, including gun-laying, fuze-setting and ammunition loading under remote control from the predictor, the question of who actually fired the gun became blurred as the war progressed. The ATS rank and file, if not always their officers, took to the new role with enthusiasm and 'Mixed' batteries and regiments with the ATS supplying two-thirds of their personnel quickly proved a success.\nBy early 1942 the training regiments were turning out a regular stream of Mixed HAA batteries, which AA Command formed into regiments to take the place of the all-male units being sent to overseas theatres of war. One such new unit was 155th (Mixed) HAA Regiment.",
    "155th (West Yorkshire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery": "The 155th (West Yorkshire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, was a New Army ('Kitchener's Army') unit raised from Leeds in the West Riding of Yorkshire during the First World War. It saw service on the Western Front, including the Battles of the Somme, Arras, Messines and Passchendaele, the German spring offensive and the final Allied Hundred Days Offensive.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army, and the newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. The flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the army to absorb and organise them, and by the time the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised on 10 December 1914, many of the units were being organised as 'Pals battalions' under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country.\n\n\n== Recruitment ==\nThe CLV (West Yorkshire) Brigade (155th Bde) Royal Field Artillery (RFA) was raised by the Leeds-based West Yorkshire Coal Owners' Association. It was therefore a 'Local Unit', raised under local initiative, not by the army mechanism like the early Kitchener 'New Armies', and therefore was comparable to the 'Pals Battalions' that formed the infantry of K5. Authority was given by the War Office (WO) on 1 February 1915, and the unit was officially taken over by the military authorities on 25 July 1915\nThe six K5 divisions were to be numbered 37th to 42nd, and CLV Bde was assigned to the 38th Division, composed of Pals battalions raised in the North of England, such as the Accrington Pals, the Sheffield City Battalion and a whole brigade of Hull Pals. All the division's RFA batteries and brigades were raised in Yorkshire towns. The WO then decided to convert the earlier K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1–K3 units, and on 27 April 1915 the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the vacant designations of the K4 formations.",

    "1580 influenza pandemic": "In 1580 a severe influenza pandemic was recorded on several continents. The virus originated in Asia and spread along the Silk Road through the Middle East into Europe and Africa, where newly established maritime trade routes and moving armies facilitated its worldwide spread. Contemporary historian Johann Boekel wrote that it spread over all of Europe in six weeks, in which thousands died and nearly everyone was infected. Those who witnessed the epidemic variously called the disease nicknames like coqueluche, Shaufkrankeit, castrone, or variations of catarrh or fever. Physicians of the time increasingly appreciated that \"epidemic catarrhs\" were being directly caused by a contagious agent instead of the stars or environment.\nThe speed with which this disease propagated across societies and the symptoms strongly resembling influenza have been the basis for historians and academics to commonly identify this as a flu pandemic. Many contemporary epidemiologists consider this to be the first ever influenza pandemic.\n\n\n== Asia ==\nThe epidemic has long been recognized as originating in Asia. The Italian historian Cesare Campana recorded in Delle Historie del Mundo (1599) that the \"mal di Montone\" quickly spread to the entirety of Africa and Europe. Infected travelers on the Silk Road brought the flu to the Levant, from whence it spread from the Ottoman Empire.",
    "1585 Ottoman expedition against the Druze": "The 1585 Ottoman expedition against the Druze, also called the 1585 Ottoman invasion of the Shuf, was an Ottoman military campaign led by Ibrahim Pasha against the Druze and other chieftains of Mount Lebanon and its environs, then a part of the Sidon-Beirut Sanjak of the province of Damascus Eyalet. It had been traditionally considered the direct consequence of a raid by bandits in Akkar against the tribute caravan of Ibrahim Pasha, then Egypt's outgoing governor, who was on his way to Constantinople. Modern research indicates that the tribute caravan arrived intact and that the expedition was instead the culmination of Ottoman attempts to subjugate the Druze and other tribal groups in Mount Lebanon dating from 1518.\nIn 1523–1524 dozens of Druze villages were burned in the Chouf area and hundreds of Druze were killed or captured by the governor Khurram Pasha, after which a period of peace ensued. Tensions resumed in the 1560s as Druze and non-Druze local dynasties, particularly the Ma'ns, Assafs and Shihabs, acquired large quantities of prohibited firearms, which were often superior to those possessed by government troops. Military action by the Ottoman governors of Damascus in the 1570s failed to disarm the chiefs and the general population or collect tax arrears, which had been building up from the 1560s.\nIbrahim Pasha was appointed to \"rectify the situation\" in the Levant in 1583 and launched the expedition against the Druze of Mount Lebanon in the summer of 1585 as a Porte-ordered diversion for his Constantinople-bound caravan. He mobilised about 20,000 soldiers, including the Janissaries of Egypt and Damascus, as well as local chieftains, namely the Bedouin Mansur ibn Furaykh and Druze rivals of the Ma'ns. Hundreds of Druze rebels were slain, thousands of muskets were confiscated and large sums of money were collected as tax arrears by Ibrahim Pasha. The Ma'nid chief Qurqumaz, one of the principal targets of the expedition, died in hiding after refusing to surrender.",
    "1592–1593 Malta plague epidemic": "The 1592–1593 Malta plague epidemic was a major outbreak of plague (Maltese: pesta) on the island of Malta, then ruled by the Order of St John. It occurred in three waves between June 1592 and September 1593, during the second plague pandemic, and it resulted in approximately 3000 deaths, which amounted to about 11% of the population. The disease was imported to Malta by Tuscan galleys that had captured vessels from Alexandria. In 1593, the Order requested assistance from Sicily to deal with the epidemic, and the measures taken were effective in containing plague.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the time of the outbreak, Malta was ruled by the Order of St John. Some sources state that plague was introduced in Malta in about 1575, but there are records of outbreaks of the disease in Malta before the arrival of the Order. Epidemics had occurred in 1427–1428 and 1523, with the latter being confined to the town of Birgu.\n\n\n== Epidemic ==\nThe plague epidemic which began in 1592 arrived in Malta indirectly from Alexandria in Ottoman-ruled Egypt. Four galleys of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany or the Order of Saint Stephen had captured two vessels from Alexandria, and took their cargo and about 150 Turkish captives with them to Malta. While en route to Malta, an outbreak of the plague began on board the ships, killing 20 crew members.",

The 15th Division was one of the weaker formations in the Belgian army. It was made up entirely of older reserve regiments which was armed with antiquated weapons of world war one vintage. Moreover, its regiments lacked the fourth heavy weapons battalion that was customary in the regiments of the active army and those of newer reserves. \nThe division was stationed behind the Albert Canal line between Herentals and Massenhoven. To compensate for its weaker units, its lines were somewhat shorter than those of its neighbouring divisions.\nAs the Belgian front at the Canal collapsed near Liège, the 15th Division was withdrawn from its positions and was made to occupy the lines between the Antwerp Position and the K-W Line, covered by the forts of Kessel and Massenhoven. When the Germans broke through and the K-W Line was abandoned, the 15th Division's line was lengthened as it was assigned a covering role for the retreat of the army.

It initially absorbed the Infantry Replacement Regiments 32 (Kolberg), 207 (Schneidemühl) and 2 (Greifswald).: 130  The initial commander of the division was Hermann Franke, who would hold this post until 13 May 1942.This initial divisional order of battle was later upgraded on 10 January 1940 through the addition of the Field Replacement Battalions 12 (Schwerin), 32 (Köslin) and 24 (Chemnitz), which were used in conjunction with the six preexisting infantry battalions to form three regiments for a total of nine battalions in the division, thus bringing the 162nd Infantry Division to regular strength. Infantry Regiment 303 was reformed from the battalions I./303, II./303 and Field Replacement Battalion 12, Infantry Regiment 314 was reformed from I./314, II./314 and Field Replacement Battalion 32, and the newly-added Infantry Regiment 329 was formed from Field Replacement Battalion 24 and the battalions III./303 and III./314. The addition of II./206 artillery detachment brought the Light Artillery Detachment 236 to a newly-formed Artillery Regiment 236 with three detachments. Furthermore, the Division Units 236 served as a source of divisional support.: 130 \nOn 20 September 1940, the staff of Artillery Regiment 236 was transferred to the 304th Infantry Division, where it was used to form the staff of Artillery Regiment 304. On 5 November of that same year, the staff of Infantry Regiment 329 as well as the battalions I./303 and I./314 were transferred to the 332nd Infantry Division, where they formed the Infantry Regiment 676. These transfers were subsequently replaced to bring the 162nd Infantry Division back to full strength.",

    "163rd (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery": "163rd (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment was an air defence unit of Britain's Royal Artillery formed during World War II. Around two-thirds of its personnel were women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The regiment defended London, operating the heaviest guns serving with Anti-Aircraft Command.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\n\nBy 1941, after two years of war Anti-Aircraft Command, tasked with defending the UK against air attack, was suffering a manpower shortage. In April its commander-in-chief, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile, proposed to overcome this by utilising the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The ATS was by law a non-combatant service, but it was decided that Defence Regulations permitted the employment of women in anti-aircraft (AA) roles other than actually firing the guns. They worked the radar and plotting instruments, range-finders and predictors, ran command posts and communications, and carried out many other duties. With the increasing automation of heavy AA (HAA) guns, including gun-laying, fuze-setting and ammunition loading under remote control from the predictor, the question of who actually fired the gun became blurred as the war progressed. The ATS rank and file, if not always their officers, took to the new role with enthusiasm and 'Mixed' batteries and regiments with the ATS supplying two-thirds of their personnel quickly proved a success.\n\nBy 1942 the training regiments were turning out a regular stream of Mixed HAA batteries, which AA Command formed into regiments to take the place of the all-male units being sent to overseas theatres of war. One such new unit was 163rd (Mixed) HAA Regiment.",

The epicenter of the earthquake was on the southern shore of Ladik Lake.  It caused widespread damage from as far west as Bolu and as far east as Erzincan, resulting in about 8,000 deaths. It is thought to be the most powerful earthquake in Turkey.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nNorth Anatolia lies across the mainly transform boundary between the Anatolian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Relative to the Eurasian Plate the Anatolian Plate is being forced westwards by the continuing northward movement of the Arabian Plate.

Most deaths were in the urban areas, including the capital Valletta and the Three Cities, which had a mortality rate of about 41%. In the rural settlements, the mortality rate was 6.9%.\nThe exact cause of the outbreak remains uncertain, but infected merchandise from North Africa seems to be a likely source since the disease first appeared in the household of a merchant who had goods from Tripoli. The epidemic spread rapidly and efforts to contain it were poor, in part due to disagreements on whether the disease was actually plague or not. Eventually strict measures were taken and the epidemic subsided after eight months.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the time of the outbreak, Malta was ruled by the Order of St John, making the country a Theocracy.

The epidemic ultimately killed around 12,000 Icelanders, close to one-quarter of the island's population at the time.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIceland in 1707 was a territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with 53,681 people according to one tally of the 1703 census. Epidemic diseases like smallpox did not naturally sustain themselves on the island due to the relatively sparse population, but frequent trade and travel with Denmark presented a vulnerability to cross-Atlantic spread of contagious diseases. Smallpox had crossed the ocean before in 1670, causing a two-year epidemic, and since then a new generation of people had developed with no immunity to the disease.\n\n\n== Epidemic ==\nIn 1707, smallpox arrived in Iceland aboard a ship from Denmark when a passenger fell sick and died with the disease. Despite being buried at sea, the index case's contaminated clothing remained and infected at least one other person on board. The next year it had spread to almost every town across Iceland. The last reported cases were in the spring of 1709. Ultimately, the outbreak may have killed a quarter of the population of Iceland at the time.",
    "1737 Valdivia earthquake": "The 1737 Valdivia earthquake struck south-central Chile on December 24 with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.5. Together with earthquakes in 1575 and 1837 the earthquake is among the historical predecessors to the great 1960 earthquake. While the overlap in affected areas is significant relative to the 1837 earthquake, the 1737 earthquake may have occurred slightly more to the north.\nThe earthquake was felt in Concepción but most damage occurred in the towns of Valdivia and Castro, Chiloé Archipelago. In both of these locations churches were destroyed by the earthquake. In addition the Valdivian Fort System and the Royal Storehouse of Valdivia took heavy damage. Landslides occurred next to Villarrica, Calafquén, and Riñihue lakes. Over all this indicates the rupture zone was about 640 km long, with most damage being concentrated in the middle section (Valdivia).\nThere is no evidence the earthquake would have produced a tsunami.",
    "1739 Yinchuan–Pingluo earthquake": "The 1739 Yinchuan–Pingluo earthquake (simplified Chinese: 银川-平罗地震; traditional Chinese: 銀川-平羅地震; pinyin: Yínchuān-píng luó dìzhèn) rocked the northern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on January 3 with an epicenter in the prefecture-level city Shizuishan. The estimated magnitude 7.1–7.6 earthquake had a maximum intensity of XI on the Mercalli intensity scale, and killed about 50,000 residents and officials. It was widely felt; perceived in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Hebei provinces. Aftershocks persisted for more than two years with the largest being a 5.5 on February 13 that same year.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nAlthough northern China is nowhere near the boundaries of tectonic plates, the region is straddled with faults and there are ongoing deformation. Ningxia lies in a complex transition zone of compression at the northeastern Tibetan Plateau to extension, horst and graben features in the Ordos Plateau. To the south, the massive strike-slip Haiyuan Fault comes in and becomes a group of reverse faults.\nThe Yinchuan graben is a 50 km (31 mi) × 160 km (99 mi) block of crust at the northern tip of Ningxia, bounded by several north–south striking normal faults. Two of these faults are the Helanshan Piedmont Fault Zone (East Helanshan  Fault) to the western boundary of the graben, and the Huang He (Yellow River) Fault to the east. Their slip rate is 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) per year.",
    "1757 Tampa expedition": "The 1757 Tampa expedition was an exploration into Tampa Bay and up the Hillsborough River led by Spanish Royal Navy captain Don Francisco Maria Celi. Documents produced during the trip include the first European-drawn map of the Tampa Bay, Florida area and a log book. The journey followed more than 200 years after Spanish Explorer Pánfilo de Narváez landed near Tampa Bay with 400 men in 1528.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn April 1757, Spanish explorer Don Francisco Maria Celi documented a trip into Tampa Bay and up the Hillsborough River. Celi's expedition came to Tampa Bay from Cuba. The party he led up the Hillsborough River was seeking pine trees suitable for use as masts on his ships. The expedition was for the Spanish Royal Navy. \nCeli reportedly erected a cross at a site he named el Pinal de la Cruz de Santa Teresa (the Pine Forest of the Cross of Saint Theresa). The site is now part of Riverhills Park in Temple Terrace, Florida. He continued upriver as far as the rapids that are now part of Hillsborough River State Park.",
    "1766 food riots": "The 1766 food riots took place across England in response to rises in the prices of wheat and other cereals following a series of poor harvests.  Riots were sparked by the first largescale exports of grain in August and peaked in September–October.  Around 131 riots were recorded, though many were relatively non-violent.  In many cases traders and farmers were forced by the rioters to sell their wares at lower rates.  In some instances, violence occurred with shops and warehouses looted and mills destroyed.  There were riots in many towns and villages across the country but particularly in the South West and the Midlands, which included the Nottingham cheese riot.\nThe Whig government of the Marquess of Rockingham implemented tax cuts on imported grain and prohibited exports in an attempt to lower the price of food.  Rockingham's successor William Pitt the Elder went further, prohibiting the use of grains in distilling and suspending more import duties.  The public responded to the riots by raising subscriptions to provide charitable relief.  These were used mainly to subsidise food for the poor but some subscriptions sought to build public mills and granaries.",
    "1772–1773 Persian Plague": "The Persian plague epidemic of 1772–1773, also simply known as the Persian Plague, was a massive outbreak of plague, more specifically Bubonic plague, in the Persian Empire, which claimed around 2 million lives in total. It was one of the most devastating Plague epidemics in recorded human history. The outbreak resulted in the introduction of several quarantine measures for the first time in the Persian Gulf regions.\n\n\n== Outbreak ==\nThe epidemic is believed to have started in Baghdad in the winter of 1772. It then spread to other parts of the Persian-controlled lands. By 1773, the epidemic reached Basra, where it proved to be especially devastating, claiming more than 250,000 lives there alone. The Plague then quickly spread further southwards along the Persian Gulf, eventually reaching Bahrain. Eastwards, the epidemic extended as far as Bombay in India (modern-day Mumbai).\nAt the peak of the outbreak, a thousand deaths were recorded on a daily basis all throughout the Persian Empire.The outbreak was contained when imposed quarantine measures among the Persian Gulf populations started to show a positive effect by the end of 1773.",

The commission released The 1776 Report on January 18, 2021, two days before the end of Trump's term of office. Historians overwhelmingly criticized the report, saying it was \"filled with errors and partisan politics\". The commission was terminated by the successive President Joe Biden on January 20, 2021, his first day in office.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe commission was conceived partly as a counter-response to The New York Times' 1619 Project, which deals with systemic racism and explores American history through an African-American framework. The first publication from the 1619 Project was in The New York Times Magazine of August 2019.\nTrump first spoke of giving students a \"patriotic education\" on September 2, 2020, and announced the new commission in a speech on September 17, 2020, in which he contended that a \"twisted web of lies\" regarding systemic racism was currently being taught in U.S. schools, calling it \"a form of child abuse.\" He reiterated his intention to establish the commission in a proclamation on October 6, 2020.\nVarious federal laws prohibit the federal government from directly regulating school curricula, which are determined by school districts under rules established by state governments.

    "1782 Influenza pandemic": "In 1782 a pandemic of influenza emerged in Asia before spreading worldwide. It resulted in severe disruption to society in Europe and the Americas as it disabled populations with sudden and widespread illness, with the flu even affecting dogs and cats. Occurring at the height of the Age of Enlightenment, was noted by contemporary physicians, generals, and medical researchers who sought to explain the infectious causes and treatments for influenza.\n\n\n== Europe ==\nThe pandemic reached Europe in the spring, and European ships quickly diffused influenza across the continent.

    "1782 Saigon massacre": "The 1782 Saigon Massacre was a massacre of ethnic Chinese carried out by the Vietnamese Tây Sơn rebels under the leadership of Nguyễn Nhạc in 1782 in the city of Saigon, which is modern-day Ho Chi Minh City. \nDuring the early phase of the Vietnamese civil war (1771–1802), many Chinese formed a military group called the Hoà Nghĩa army that fought for the Nguyen lord who was the Tây Sơn's enemy. In 1782 the Tây Sơn led by Nguyễn Nhạc launched an attack on Saigon and succeeded in capturing the city. However, one of Nhạc's key lieutenants was killed by an ethnic Chinese general fighting for the Nguyen. Nhạc decided to clean out Chinese settlers in Saigon. Tây Sơn troops burned and pillaged the shops of Chinese merchants and massacred thousands of Chinese residents. This was more generally reflected by Tây Sơn's anger at the increasing support given by the Chinese community to their Nguyen rivals. After this victory, the Tây Sơn leaders returned north in June, leaving the city in the hands of their lieutenants. Chinese civilian death toll ranged from 4,000 to 20,000.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDutton, George Edson (2006).",

The plot was influenced by the opposition of the nobility against Gustav III because of the Union and Security Act during the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790), and the plan was to convince Charles to act as the central figure and symbol of this opposition.

    "1789 Virginia's 5th congressional district election": "The first election for Virginia's 5th congressional district took place on February 2, 1789, for a two-year term to commence on March 4 of that year. In a race that turned on the candidates' positions on the need for amendments (the Bill of Rights) to the recently ratified U.S. Constitution, James Madison defeated James Monroe for a place in the House of Representatives of the First Congress. It is the only congressional election in U.S. history in which two future presidents opposed each other.\nThe race came about when former governor Patrick Henry and other Anti-Federalists in the Virginia General Assembly, who had opposed the state's ratification of the Constitution, sought to defeat Madison, who had been a strong advocate for ratification, and who wanted to become a member of the new House of Representatives; they had already defeated him in the legislative election to choose Virginia's first U.S. senators. They put forward Monroe, a young but experienced politician who was a war hero wounded at the 1776 Battle of Trenton, as a candidate for the seat. Monroe did not seek the contest, but once drafted campaigned vigorously. Despite bitterly cold weather, the two candidates debated outdoors; traveling after one such meeting, Madison suffered frostbite on his face.\nAlthough Madison had earlier stated that amendments to the Constitution were not necessary, during the campaign he took the position that they were, but should be proposed by Congress, rather than by an Article V Convention that Anti-Federalists such as Monroe and Henry supported. Madison won the election comfortably, to the satisfaction of his supporters such as President-elect George Washington. The race did not affect Madison's friendship with Monroe, who was elected to the Senate in 1790, and who would serve as Madison's Secretary of State and succeed him as president in 1817.",

'Assault Field Regiments' were equipped and trained for assault landings from the sea, but most of the planned amphibious operations in Burma were cancelled because of a lack of landing craft, even for training, before 1945. 366 Battery was sometimes referred to as 366 Light Battery because of its small guns: the 3.7-inch howitzer was also chosen for the new 'Jungle Field Regiments' because of its accuracy at close range and for its high angle fire.\n\n\n=== Arakan ===\n36th Indian Division was in reserve for the Second Arakan Offensive launched in January 1944.",

The demand was made of President Sukarno while the Merdeka Palace was surrounded.\nDue to tensions regarding potential army reorganization to conserve budgets, the Indonesian Army's high command disputed with the parliament regarding excessive civilian meddling in military affairs. After the dismissal of a pro-government officer in July 1952, the parliament began demanding a significant restructuring of armed forces leadership.

The battalion was decommissioned on December 6, 1945.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Organization ===\nThe 2d Airdrome Battalion was commissioned on October 28, 1942 at Camp Linda Vista, San Diego, California. It was one of two airdrome battalions formed by the Marine Corps specifically to defend airfields in the China Burma India Theater. Those airfields were overrun by the Japanese before the battalions deployed so the Marine Corps quickly changed their tasking to missions in the Pacific Theater.  \nThe first thirteen men in the battalion came over from the 12th Defense Battalion joining the newly formed Headquarters and Service Battery under the authority of Area General Order 15-42. While organizing and training in Southern California the battalion spent extensive time at Camp Callan, near La Jolla and Camp Dunlap in the Imperial Valley. The 2d Airdrome Battalion departed the United States near the end of May 1943 onboard the USS Henderson (AP-1) and SS Cape Clear (AK-5039).",

    "17th Venice Architecture Biennale": "The 17th International Architecture Exhibition of the Venice Architecture Biennale, is an upcoming international architecture exhibition. The Biennale takes place biennially in Venice, Italy. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the exhibition will take place in 2021 instead of 2020.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe 17th Exhibition will run between May 22 and November 21, 2021, with two pre-opening days. In light of several festival postponements in northern Italy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been speculation about delaying the exhibition, and while it was originally announced as opening in May, amid increased international precautions over the following weeks, the exhibition's opening was initially postponed to August, halving the exhibition's run, before being rescheduled to the following year\n\n\n== Central exhibition ==\nCurated by Hashim Sarkis, the exhibition's theme is \"How will we live together?\" From 46 participating countries, 114 participants will present work at the Giardini's Central Pavilion, the Arsenale, Forte Marghera, and the external spaces around those areas. National participants were asked to focus on \"the need for more inclusive social housing and urban connectivity.\"\n\n\n== National pavilions ==\nThe exhibition will include 63 national pavilions in the Giardini and across the city. \nThe 17th exhibition marked the first participation from Grenada, Iraq, and Uzbekistan.\n\n\n=== Iraq ===\nThe first-ever participation by Iraq was an exhibition called Ark re-imagined: The expeditionary pavilion by Rashad Salim, curated by Safina Projects, produced by Community Jameel and Culturunners, and commissioned by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities.

    "17α-Ethynyl-3β-androstanediol": "17α-Ethynyl-3β-androstanediol (developmental code HE-3539; also known as 17α-ethynyl-5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol) is a synthetic estrogen and a 17α-substituted derivative of 3β-androstanediol which was never marketed.\n17α-Ethynyl-3β-androstanediol shows high affinity for the estrogen receptors in vitro (IC50Tooltip Half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 16 nM for ERα and 126 nM for ERβ relative to values of 8 nM at ERα and 7 nM at ERβ for estradiol), and activates the estrogen receptors in vitro (EC50Tooltip Half-maximal effective concentration value of 0.9 nM relative to 0.002 nM for estradiol). It also has weak affinity for the androgen receptor in vitro (IC50 = 277 nM relative to 15 nM for dihydrotestosterone), but doesn't appear to activate the receptor. 17α-Ethynyl-3β-androstanediol may produce 17α-ethynyl-3α-androstanediol and 5α-dihydroethisterone (5α-dihydro-17α-ethynyltestosterone) as active metabolites in vivo. In accordance with its in-vitro estrogenic activity, 17α-ethynyl-3β-androstanediol produces estrogenic effects like uterotrophy and testicular atrophy in animals.\nEsters of 17α-ethynyl-3β-androstanediol have been developed and studied.\n17α-Ethynyl-3β-androstanediol is a positional isomer of 17α-ethynyl-3α-androstanediol, and is a metabolite of this compound in vivo via metabolic inversion of the position of the C3 hydroxyl group. It may be involved in the biological activity of 17α-ethynyl-3α-androstanediol.\n\nAnalogues of 17α-ethynyl-3β-androstanediol include 17α-ethynyl-3α-androstanediol, ethinylandrostenediol (17α-ethynyl-5-androstenediol), ethandrostate (17α-ethynyl-5-androstenediol 3β-cyclohexanepropionate), ethinylestradiol (17α-ethynylestradiol), ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), and 5α-dihydroethisterone (17α-ethynyldihydrotestosterone).",
    "17β-Methyl-17α-dihydroequilenin": "17β-Methyl-17α-dihydroequilenin (developmental code name NCI-122), also known as 17β-methyl-6,8-didehydro-17α-estradiol, is a synthetic steroidal estrogen which was never marketed. It is the C17β methylated derivative of 17α-dihydroequilenin, an equine estrogen and constituent of conjugated estrogens (Premarin). 17α-Dihydroequilenin itself is an analogue of 17α-estradiol, the C17 epimer of estradiol (or 17β-estradiol). NCI-122 has respective relative binding affinities of about 8.1% and 16% for the ERα and ERβ when compared to estradiol. It is far less potent as an estrogen in comparison to estradiol, with relative estrogenic potencies at the ERα and ERβ of 1.4% and 0.81%, respectively. Nonetheless, NCI-122 acts as a full agonist of the ERα (ERβ was not assessed) and has estrogenic activity similar to that of estradiol at sufficiently high concentrations. The mechanisms of the lower potency of NCI-122 and related estrogens (e.g., 17α-estradiol and equilenin) relative to estradiol have been studied.",
    "18-Hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone": "18-Hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone (also known as 18-OH-DOC, 18,21-dihydroxyprogesterone, and 18,21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) is an endogenous steroid and a mineralocorticoid. It is a hydroxylated metabolite of 11-deoxycorticosterone.\nIn rats, conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone into 18-OH-DOC is catalyzed by the CYP11B3 enzyme.\nIn humans, 18-OH-DOC is a weak mineralocorticoid. It may be increased in 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) deficiency, in aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) deficiency, in primary aldosteronism, and may also indicate a histologic variant of the aldosteronoma. Excessive secretion of 18-OH-DOC can cause mineralocorticoid excess syndrome, although these cases are very rare.",
    "18-Hydroxycortisol": "18-Hydroxycortisol is an endogenous steroid, a metabolite of cortisol.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n18-hydroxycortisol has been proposed as a biomarker for certain diseases. In humans, 18-hydroxycortisol has no biological activity on glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors. In healthy subjects, the biosynthesis of 18-hydroxycortisol is low. The highest synthesis of 18-hydroxycortisol was found in certain cases of hypertension like in type 1 familial hyperaldosteronism (glucocorticoid-curable hyperaldosteronism) and type 3 familial hyperaldosteronism, where the adrenal glands are enlarged up to six times their normal size. Increased synthesis is also found in patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas. ACTH stimulation test increases urinary excretion of 18-hydroxycortisol, and dexamethasone inhibits the excretion.\n\n\n== Biosynthesis ==\nIn patients with familial hyperaldosteronism type 1, there is a genetic crossover between specific regions of the CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 genes. This crossover results in the expression of an additional gene in the zona fasciculata, which is regulated by ACTH. The additional gene plays a role in synthesizing 18-hydroxycortisol by 18-hydroxylation of cortisol. This gene also plays a role in the biosynthesis of aldosterone and 18-oxocortisol.",
    "18-Methyltestosterone": "18-Methyltestosterone (18-MT) is an androgen/anabolic steroid (AAS) which was never marketed. Along with 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone) and 17α-ethynyltestosterone (ethisterone), it is a parent structure of a number of progestogens and AAS. These include the progestogens levonorgestrel (17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone) and its derivatives (e.g., desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, gestrinone) as well as AAS such as norboletone (17α-ethyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone) and tetrahydrogestrinone (THG; δ9,11-17α-ethyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone).",

    "1810 House Tax Hartal": "The House Tax Hartal of 1810–11 was an occasion of nonviolent resistance to protest a tax in parts of British India, with a particularly noteworthy example of hartal (a form of general strike) in the vicinity of Varanasi.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1810 the government attempted to extend a house tax that was in effect in Calcutta to other areas in Eastern India: Varinasi, Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha.\nInflation, crop failures, and widespread poverty made the tax especially difficult to bear.: 424–427 \nVarious non-governmental civil society groups in Varanasi met to decide on a course of opposition to the tax, and eventually decided on a hartal which included a general strike.\n\n\n== Hartal ==\nThe strike was extraordinarily comprehensive. According to one commentator:: 334 \n\nEverything was at a stand: the dead bodies were cast unceremoniously into the river, because there were none to perform the obsequial rites; and the very thieves refrained from the exercise of their vocation, although the shops and houses were left without protection…\nThe protesters gathered in a mass protest near the European occupation government authority buildings outside of town, and were joined by people from neighboring towns, in numbers variously estimated at more than two hundred thousand: 334  or between twenty and thirty thousand people. They presented a petition to the magistrate asking for the repeal of the tax. Meanwhile, they remained peaceably assembled throughout the days, returning to their homes at night, from December 26, 1810 to January 8, 1811.: 334  They explained this tactic in their petition thusly:: 428–429 \n\nThe manner and custom in this country, from time immemorial, is this: that, whenever any act affecting everyone generally, is committed by the Government, the poor, the aged, the infirm, the women, all forsake their families and their homes, expose themselves to the inclemency of the seasons and to other kinds of inconveniencies, and make known their affliction and distress, that the Government, which is more considerate than our parents, may observe their condition and extend indulgence to its subjects.\nThe tax collector commented on the nonviolent resistance strategy in this way:\n\nAt present open violence does not seem their aim, they seem rather to vaunt their security in being unarmed in that a military force would not use deadly weapons against such inoffensive foes. And in this confidence they collect and increase, knowing that the civil power cannot disperse them, and thinking that the military will not.\nThe protest began to flag, but was revitalized by government intransigence (it declared the protest assembly illegal on January 13, 1811).",

Every Federalist member of congress voted against declaring war.\nA Federalist statesman in the Maryland House of Delegates named Alexander Contee Hanson launched the Federal Republican & Commercial Gazette newspaper in 1808.

Cordelle and fellow resident, Jacob Sanderson, began a petition to attract a club to city to play in the Canadian Premier League, which they tentatively nicknamed as the Kempenfelt Crew. The petition received widespread support including from figures such as former professional player Danny Dichio, Gambian national team coach Tom Saintfiet, Sunderland AFC chair Niall Quinn as well as several local politicians. Cordelle reached out to Andrew Weilgus, the owner of New Jersey-based National Premier Soccer League club Atlantic City FC, over LinkedIn, who was interested in the project and familiar with the region. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the NPSL season, which resulted in Weilgus taking a greater interest into establishing the project and he reached out others to further discussions about forming a new club, with Weilgus handling the branding, marketing, and development for the new club, while others worked reached out to League1 Ontario to discuss what was needed for the club to be eligible. The club's formation was officially announced in June 2020. The club reached out to Georgian College with the aim of playing their matches out of Georgian's J.C.

Madison won Virginia, his home state, by a margin of 46.2%.\nThe race in the state was noteworthy for a dispute within the Federalist Party, who had formed an unofficial pact to support rebel Democratic-Republican candidate DeWitt Clinton nationwide, while putting up Federalist candidate Jared Ingersoll as Clinton's running-mate. The Virginia state Federalist Party rejected this pact, however, and instead nominated Rufus King, the party's vice-presidential candidate in the two previous elections, for president, while nominating William Richardson Davie as King's running-mate. Despite the state's substantial number of presidential electors and the closeness of the race nationally, the dispute did not have a major impact on the election's outcome, as Madison was never considered likely to lose his home state.",

It occurred between March 1813 and January 1814 on Malta and between February and May 1814 on Gozo, and the epidemic was officially declared to be over in September 1814. It resulted in approximately 4500 deaths, which was about 5% of the islands' population.\nThe plague outbreak had begun in Constantinople in 1812 and it spread to other parts of the Ottoman Empire, including Egypt. The disease was imported to Malta from Alexandria on board the brigantine San Nicola in late March 1813. Some of its crew members had contracted the disease and died, and although the vessel and crew were quarantined, the disease spread to the local population since infected cargo from the vessel was stolen and sold in Valletta. The disease appeared in the city in mid-April, and the outbreak was severe by mid-May.\nThe British colonial government took strict measures in order to contain the plague, although this was done too late to prevent the outbreak from spreading in its early stages. The urban area around the Grand Harbour was isolated from the rest of the island, and settlements with high mortality rates were cordoned off. Violations of these regulations were met with harsh penalties including death, and several people were executed for concealing their infection.",

Less than a month after the by-election, Parliament was dissolved and the 1831 United Kingdom general election was called, in which Ferguson also won.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSir Robert Ferguson, 2nd Baronet, a Whig politician with conservative leanings, had been elected to the House of Commons for the Londonderry City constituency at the 1830 United Kingdom general election.  The 1830 election had been held in the city between 11 and 16 August and the declared result was 258 votes for Ferguson and 87 for his Tory opponent Captain John Richard James Hart.  Ferguson was the sitting mayor of Londonderry and hence was also the constituency's returning officer. Three petitions were lodged against the election, on 15, 16 and 22 November 1830 by Hart and local electors.",

    "1831 reform riots": "The 1831 reform riots occurred after the Second Reform Bill was defeated in Parliament in October 1831.  There were civil disturbances in London, Leicester, Yeovil, Sherborne, Exeter, Bath and Worcester and riots at Nottingham, Derby and Bristol.  Targets included Nottingham Castle, home of the anti-reform Duke of Newcastle, other private houses and jails.  In Bristol, three days of rioting followed the arrival in the city of the anti-reform judge Charles Wetherell; a significant portion of the city centre was burnt, £300,000 of damage inflicted and up to 250 casualties occurred.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe British parliament consists of two houses: the House of Lords and the House of Commons.  In the early 19th-century the House of Lords was populated by hereditary peers and the House of Commons by Members of Parliament (MPs) elected to represent constituencies. The areas covered by the constituencies had not been amended to reflect population change and so there were many so-called rotten boroughs, returning one or two MPs from only a small number of voters, while some new urban centres such as Manchester had no MPs.  The franchise was small with only 5% of the British populace able to cast a vote at a general election.\nIn March 1831, an attempt was made by the Whigs to introduce a Reform Bill to address the matter.  This was defeated in parliament and the prime minister, Earl Grey, resigned.",

This earthquake with an estimated moment magnitude as high as 8.3, was one of the largest in the country since 1762.

Damage was enormous in Ava and hundreds of people died.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nMyanmar is wedged between four tectonic plates; the Indian, Eurasian, Sunda and Burma plates that interact due to active geological processes. Along the west coast of the Coco Islands, off the Rahkine coast, and into Bangladesh, is a highly oblique convergent boundary known as the Sunda megathrust. This large fault marks the boundary between the Indian and Burma plates. The megathrust emerges from the seafloor in Bangladesh, where it runs parallel and east of the Chin Hills.

    "1839 Martinique earthquake": "The 1839 Martinique earthquake occurred on the morning of January 11 with an estimated magnitude of 7.8 Ms , the largest in the Lesser Antilles since 1690. The maximum intensity of this earthquake was assigned IX on both the Mercalli and MSK intensity scales, which left the cities of Saint-Pierre and Fort Royal almost completely destroyed. Estimation on the number of human losses varies from 390 to 4,000 making this one of the deadliest earthquakes in the Caribbean.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nThe Lesser Antilles subduction zone marks the boundary where the North American Plate subducts or dives beneath the Caribbean Plate at ~2 cm/yr along the subduction interface. Interaction between these two lithospheres can sometimes produce megathrust earthquakes although there has been no recent megathrust quakes on the fault other than the 1839 and 1843 events. Moderately large earthquakes have occurred near the megathrust in recent years but none on the megathrust. Since 1973, there have only been just a little over 30 thrust earthquakes on the subduction zone with magnitudes around the 5.0 range. A plausible explanation for this is the slow rate of convergence resulting in the megathrust becoming seismically devoid of activity for hundreds to thousands of years before rupturing in great quakes. A similar effect was seen prior to the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, and in Japan's Nankai Trough and the Cascadia subduction zone. At the present moment, the Lesser Antilles subduction zone has been determined to be locked and has the potential to generate an earthquake of Mw 8.95 to 9.58.",

    "183rd (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery": "183rd (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment was an air defence unit of Britain's Royal Artillery formed during World War II. Around two-thirds of its personnel were women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The regiment was heavily engaged in Operation Diver, defending England against V-1 flying bombs, and later was deployed to Antwerp to carry out anti-Diver duties there in the closing stages of the war.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\n\nBy 1941, after two years of war Anti-Aircraft Command, tasked with defending the UK against air attack, was suffering a manpower shortage. In April its commander-in-chief, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile, proposed to overcome this by utilising the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The ATS was by law a non-combatant service, but it was decided that Defence Regulations permitted the employment of women in anti-aircraft (AA) roles other than actually firing the guns. They worked the radar and plotting instruments, rangefinders and predictors, ran command posts and communications, and carried out many other duties. With the increasing automation of heavy AA (HAA) guns, including gun-laying, fuze-setting and ammunition loading under remote control from the predictor, the question of who actually fired the gun became blurred as the war progressed. The ATS rank and file, if not always their officers, took to the new role with enthusiasm and 'Mixed' batteries and regiments with the ATS supplying two-thirds of their personnel quickly proved a success.\n\nBy late 1942 the training regiments were turning out a regular stream of Mixed HAA batteries, which AA Command formed into regiments to take the place of the all-male units being sent to overseas theatres of war. One such new unit was 183rd (Mixed) HAA Regiment.",
    "183rd Mixed Brigade": "The 183rd Mixed Brigade - originally created as the 3rd Asturian Brigade - was one of the mixed brigades created by the Spanish Republican Army for the defense of the Second Spanish Republic.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe unit was created at the beginning of February 1937 in Grullos, from the CNT nº3 battalion, being assigned to the 1st Asturian Division. The command of the Brigade fell to Víctor Álvarez González, who received military advice from Pedro Martínez Coll.\nOn April 27, the brigade set out with the 213rd, 216th and 230th battalions to the Vizcaya front, now under the command of the Joaquín Burgos Riestra. Upon its arrival in Vizcaya, it was added to the 2nd Basque Division, placing two of its battalions in Amorebieta and another in Miravalles. During the fighting of the Battle of Bilbao, on June 13 the unit was practically destroyed in the vicinity of the so-called \"Belt of Death\" —the last of the defensive lines that protected Bilbao. Its remains, however, managed to withdraw and later return to Asturias.\nOn August 6, the unit renamed the \"183rd Mixed Brigade\", within the 57th Division of the 16th Army Corps, giving command of it to José Penido Iglesias. After the start of the Asturias Offensive the 183rd MB was sent to Colombres, with the mission of defending the coastal highway, being added to Division «A» (provisional). On September 5, the Republicans lost control of Llanes, so the brigade was withdrawn from the front, towards Mieres, to join Division \"C\".",

    "1846–1848 Newfoundland potato famine": "The islands of Newfoundland and Ireland, in addition to sharing similar northern latitudes and facing each other across the Atlantic Ocean, also had in common, during the middle of the 19th century, a heavy dependence on a single agricultural crop, the potato—a dependence that allowed the same blight that precipitated the Great Famine in Ireland to wreak havoc on this former British colony as well.  Though acute, and the source of great suffering, the famine in Newfoundland lasted for fewer years than its Irish contemporary, which extended from 1845 to 1849. Beginning a year later, in 1846, it ended with the return to prosperity of the local fisheries in the spring and summer of 1848.\n\n\n== Background and context ==\nThe first known outbreak of the potato blight, Phytophthora infestans, occurred in the eastern United States in 1843.  As the blight spread to the north, it also crossed the ocean, reaching the potato fields of Ireland in September 1845, three months before completing its journey along the American coast and arriving on the Southern Shore of Newfoundland.\nAlthough the blight destroyed potato crops throughout North America and Europe, most of the populated regions in the Northern Hemisphere maintained an agricultural diversity sufficient to withstand the loss of the potato.  Ireland, however, suffered severely, with millions relying on the potato as nearly their sole source of sustenance.  Newfoundland at the time, with a population that was 50% Irish, also relied heavily on its potato crop, but had the advantage of bountiful fisheries (seals in the spring, codfish in the summer).\n\n\n== Failure of the fisheries ==\nThe famine in Newfoundland was preceded by an unusual train of disasters that greatly aggravated the effects of the blight when it arrived.  The returns from the annual seal hunt in the spring of 1846 had been disappointing.",

In 1859, Stockholm inaugurated its own central system for tending to the latrine and waste of the city, which radically improved the hygiene in Stockholm, a reform which was reportedly influenced by the 1853 outbreak.

This convention was brought on by the work of Colonel F. A. Seely and J. Milton Turner, as they had both researched the conditions of public schools for black children in Missouri during the preceding two years. The President of this convention; J. Milton Turner, established the convention out of the sheer lack of public schools and normal schools for blacks. They additionally met to address the deliberate lack of support from local school boards for black public and normal schools. Over the course of the convention, committees were called upon to present the convention's case for equal education to the people of color of Missouri and to state officials. The majority of their points touched on how state funds for schools were used. In the final days, the convention proposed a bill that would be recommended to the Missouri legislature; this bill outlined the need and plan for a state normal school to train teachers of color. This bill guaranteed funds for the school and required the trustees of the school to certify that suitable grounds and resources would be provided for the school under the supervision of the state board of education. The women who had catered the meetings and a women's choir who had performed after a prayer were thanked for their part in the convention. These acts were the only kind of political participation these women could engage in, as women were not allowed to vote or participate in the convention.",

The Committee declined to hold that Dean ineligible to sit as an alien. Smith had based his re-election nomination on the basis that Dean was ineligible to be elected as he had not been a resident for 5 years after naturalisation, relying upon legal opinions given by Sir James Martin, Sir William Manning and Joseph Innes.\n\nThe Electoral Act of 1858 distinguished between a natural born subject, a \"person born in Her Majesty's dominions or either of whose parents was so born\", and a naturalised subject, a \"person who in England is or shall be naturalized and every person made a denizen or having received a certificate\" under the Aliens Act 1847 (NSW) and taken the required oath.

McCook, who already had been territorial Governor from 1869 to 1873, was appointed for another term by President Ulysses S. Grant after incumbent Governor Samuel Elbert had been removed due to misconduct in the Land Office in Pueblo. Elbert had supporters that claimed he should not have been relieved from his office because he was not involved in any misconduct. McCook, whose first administration was considered tainted by corruption, was also fiercely opposed by Jerome B. Chaffee, an Elbert supporter, who was the Territory's Delegate to the House of Representative at the time. Many in the territory saw McCook's appointment as an affront. The battle for his Senate confirmation turned into a feud between Chaffee and President Grant. Chaffee even threatened to resign if McCook was confirmed in the Senate. After five months of testimony and multiple accusations against McCook, the Senate confirmed his appointment on June 19, 1874, by a one-vote majority.\nAfter he had returned to Colorado, Governor McCook asked President Grant to relieve all political appointees from their duties, which had been recommended by Delegate Chaffee.",

Coal was mined at the property and William Pitt was the colliery manager. In October 1875 Thomas Brown responded to a tender for the supply of coal to the railway, however no contract was awarded. In December 1875 a fresh tender was called and William Pitt personally submitted a tender which was accepted. Samuel Gray said in the Legislative Assembly that Thomas Brown leased the colliery to William Pitt and that the only connection between them was one of landlord and tenant.\nThe Committee found that Thomas Brown was the owner of the Eskbank Colliery, the coal supplied by William Pitt was taken from the Eskbank Colliery and that Thomas Brown had a \"direct interest in a contract entered into with the Government by the said William Pitt for the supply of engine coal for the Great Southern and Western Railways\" and was therefore disqualified from being a member of the Legislative Assembly.\nAfter the Committee report was tabled Thomas Brown attempted to resign, however the Legislative Assembly adopted the report of the Committee and declared the seat was vacant.\nThe question of whether Hugh Taylor had an interest in a contract for the supply of meat to the government asylum at Parramatta was referred to the Committee on the same day as Thomas Brown. Taylor resigned after the report on Thomas Brown had been tabled, but before the Committee had reported on whether he too was disqualified, and the resulting by-election was held on Thursday 20 April.",

Cronin, would have become elector, giving Tilden the 185 votes he needed to secure the presidency.\nOn December 4, Secretary of State Stephen F. Chadwick declared that Watts and the other two Republican electors (John C. Cartwright and W. H. Odell) had been elected, but Governor La Fayette Grover issued a certificate to Cronin instead of Watts. On December 6, the three Republicans met and cast their votes for Hayes and his running mate William A. Wheeler, while Cronin appointed two others in Cartwright and Odell's steads - Cronin voted for Tilden and his running mate Thomas A. Hendricks while the others voted for Hayes and Wheeler. Both sets of returns were sent to Washington, D.C., with Cronin's bearing a certificate from the Governor and Watts' bearing the return of votes from the Secretary of State. Ultimately, the vote of the Watts slate was chosen by the Electoral Commission, confirming Hayes and Wheeler's victory in the election.",

The election was called following the dissolution of the Landtag due to a currency crisis in the country. The Landtag election that took place on 30 April was suspended and did not resume until 18 October.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFrom 1873 to 1876, the Austro-Hungarian florin, which was being used as legal tender in Liechtenstein since 1859, dropped in value by 10%. This created disadvantages in trade between Liechtenstein and Switzerland, especially for the Oberland region. However, the Unterland region did not see any visible losses as it mainly traded with the region of Vorarlberg in Austria.\nIn 1876, Liechtenstein gained monetary sovereignty in a renewed customs treaty with Austria. This was followed by Liechtenstein adopting the Swiss franc as legal tender on 23 December 1876 following demands in the country for a stable gold currency. The Unterland region opposed the adoption of the Swiss franc with region's four Landtag members resigning prior to the move.\nIn response, the Unterland region threatened in January 1877 to secede from Liechtenstein to join Austria if the Landtag is not dissolved and if the adoption of the Swiss franc is not annulled.",

Additionally, it was the only time a Democrat won any counties other than Las Animas, Bent, and Huerfano until 1896.\nHancock's strength was part of a brief surge for Democrats in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific: Democrats captured California for the first time since 1856, Nevada for the first time ever, and fell only 1.63% short in Oregon. This surge can largely be attributed to a letter attributed to Garfield, first printed in a New York newspaper named Truth, that declared Garfield was in favor of allowing Chinese immigration for its cheap labor. Despite the fact that it was a blatant falsehood, it cost Republicans in the west where Chinese immigrants were often accused of stealing jobs from American laborers.",

All contemporary thirty-eight states were part of the 1880 United States presidential election. Kentucky voters chose twelve electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nEver since the Civil War, Kentucky had been shaped politically by divisions created by that war between secessionist, Democratic counties and Unionist, Republican ones, although the state as a whole leaned Democratic throughout this era and the GOP would never carry the state during the Third Party System at either presidential or gubernatorial level. Following Samuel J. Tilden’s 24-point victory in the state in 1876, the tobacco-growing Jackson Purchase and Western Coal Field were affected by the Greenback movement. This aimed to restore the fiat money system used to pay for the Civil War, in order to pay off farmer’s debts. It also was aimed at regulating the railroads which the western landowners – many former slaveholders – saw as siphoning the profit from their cash crop economy.\nThe Greenback movement managed to carry 8.3 percent of the vote in the 1879 gubernatorial election, but a rebound in tobacco prices and the adoption of some key elements of the Greenback platform by Democrats ensured that this decline was arrested and Greenback nominee James B. Weaver won only 4.39 percent of Kentucky’s ballots. Weaver did best in the regions where the Greenback insurgency was always strongest, but received no votes at all in fourteen of Kentucky’s 117 counties (most of those lying in the Eastern Coalfield).

It began on July 19, 1881, and lasted into August 1881. The strike began as an effort to establish better pay, more respect and autonomy, and a uniform base salary for their work.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn Atlanta following the Civil War, many African American women were employed as washerwomen, also known as laundresses. There were more African American women employed as washerwomen than in any other domestic work, representing over half of their total workforce. Many of those employed in this field made between $4 and $8 per month.\nIn July 1881, several washerwomen in the city founded the Washing Society. At the first meeting, held in a local black church, officials were elected and a uniform rate for washerwomen was decided.

    "1884 United States presidential election in Tennessee": "The 1884 United States presidential election in Tennessee took place on November 4, 1884, as part of the 1884 United States presidential election. Tennessee voters chose twelve representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nFor over a century after the Civil War, Tennessee’s white citizenry was divided according to partisan loyalties established in that war. Unionist regions covering almost all of East Tennessee, Kentucky Pennyroyal-allied Macon County, and the five West Tennessee Highland Rim counties of Carroll, Henderson, McNairy, Hardin and Wayne voted Republican – generally by landslide margins – as they saw the Democratic Party as the “war party” who had forced them into a war they did not wish to fight. Contrariwise, the rest of Middle and West Tennessee who had supported and driven the state’s secession was equally fiercely Democratic as it associated the Republicans with Reconstruction. After the state’s white landowning class re-established its rule in the early 1870s, blacks and Unionist whites nonetheless forged adequate support for the GOP to produce a competitive political system for two decades, although during this era the Republicans could only capture statewide offices when the Democratic Party was divided on this issue of payment of state debt.\nWhite Democrats in West Tennessee were always aiming to eliminate black political influence, and during the 1880s they attempted to do this by election fraud and stuffing of ballot boxes. However, at this stage the Republican Party was a strong force throughout the state and the Democratic Party had not yet achieved a monopoly in power in secessionist areas, with its statewide vote not rising above sixty percent in any year’s congressional race.\nTennessee was won by the Democratic nominees, Governor Grover Cleveland of New York and his running mate former Senator and Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana. Cleveland and Hendricks defeated the Republican nominees, former Secretary of State and Senator James G. Blaine of Maine and his running mate Senator John A.

According to a newspaper account, the new rule was adopted by MAC's opponents and \"apparently was designed expressly to prevent Ames and Donnelly from playing with the Manhattans.\" MAC withdrew from the AFU in protest of the ruling.\nA further controversy arose in late November 1891 as to whether MAC should be deemed a professional club for hosting a game between Yale and Princeton that generated receipts of $50,000.",

However, the gulf between Arsenal and the professional sides from the North soon became apparent, and Arsenal faced the threat of their amateur players being lured away by the money professional sides could offer; after Derby County had played Arsenal in an FA Cup tie in 1891, they attempted to sign two of Arsenal's amateur players on professional contracts.\nRoyal Arsenal's move to professionalism in 1891 was frowned upon by many of the amateur southern clubs, and they were banned from participating in local competitions by the London Football Association. With friendlies and the FA Cup the only matches available for Royal Arsenal, they attempted to set up a southern equivalent of The Football League, but the move failed. The club changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal in 1893 when it formed a limited liability company to raise capital to purchase the Manor Ground. Woolwich Arsenal's future looked bleak until the Football League came to their rescue by inviting them to join in 1893. Arsenal were the first Southern club to enter the League, initially joining the Second Division; in response, some of the club's amateur players who rejected professionalism and wanted a workers' team to represent just the Royal Arsenal, broke away to form a short-lived alternative side, Royal Ordnance Factories.",

The eye crossed the island from southeast to northwest in about seven hours. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. Large numbers of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless, and four people were killed. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. In addition to the intense winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding.",

They are noteworthy in college football for becoming one of, if not the only example of a mid-season consolidation of two distinct football programs into a single team.\nBefore the merger of each school's football program, Rush Medical and Lake Forest both had plans for a regular season and schedule, which included many of the same opponents, such as Chicago, Beloit, Chicago Athletic Association, and the Armour Institute of Technology.  The idea of a merger between the two teams was first proposed by G. W. King on or around October 10, 1895, and was quickly adopted on October 12 with the help of J. D. Nary and J. H. Rice.  The consolidation of both programs was easier than would otherwise be expected, given that Rush Medical was already affiliated with Lake Forest, the former being an affiliate graduate college of the latter.  The plan was for Rush Medical, which had attained several experienced football players from their successful 1894 season, to forgo their men to Lake Forest, in return for the university's superior schedule, which included regional powerhouses Wisconsin, Michigan, and Notre Dame. The law programs of Chicago University and Lake Forest were also combed for possible talent.  With the consolidation, the combined team hoped to stand a better chance against the more accomplished Midwestern football programs.  Unfortunately, this strategy did not seem to play out for either team, and the Rush–Lake Forest experiment lost the majority of their remaining contests for the 1895 season.",

The identity of the perpetrators is disputed: the attack was attributed to anarchists but this was a result of forced confessions through torture.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAnarchism in Spain had been increasingly popular among workers' groups since the 1870s.  The continual failure of general strikes as a tool for galvanizing change to working conditions combined with the violent repression of the state against the strikes (such as the Rio Tinto massacre) disappointed many, and the advocacy for use of violence began to take hold.  In Catalonia, radical anarchist sentiment was particularly strong and previous attacks had been carried out by Paulí Pallàs against Arsenio Martínez Campos in September 1893 and by Santiago Salvador at the Liceu Theatre in November 1893.  Both assailants were soon executed and in 1894 the government began an outright suppression of anarchism.\n\n\n== Bombing ==\nA small group of anarchists originally planned to bomb the Corpus Christi procession on June 6, 1896, at Barcelona Cathedral.

It also pitched local and national authorities as well as medical experts in heated arguments about the nature of the disease and the way to contain it, namely, the controversial decision to surround the city by a military-enforced cordon sanitaire for four months, imposed by the government of Prime Minister José Luciano de Castro.\nThe city's Medical Health Officer, Ricardo Jorge, head of the city's Municipal Services of Health and Hygiene and of the Municipal Bacteriological Laboratory, led the efforts to contain the disease and personally gathered laboratory proof to correctly identify the responsible infectious agent: this earned him a great reputation as a modern sanitarian and bacteriologist and launched his highly successful national and international career.\nThere were 132 deaths attributed to the plague outbreak, out of 320 total cases. Eminent bacteriologist Luís da Câmara Pestana contracted the disease after receiving a small scratch while examining a plague corpse during the outbreak, and died shortly afterwards.\nThe plague outbreak had considerable political, social, and economic repercussions: it exacerbated class divisions and tensions between republicans in Porto and the royalist government in Lisbon (the centuries-old Portuguese Monarchy and would be replaced by the Portuguese First Republic in a revolution just 10 years later).

    "18th-century prints of Bach's four-part chorales": "In the period following Johann Sebastian Bach's death in 1750, apart from the publication of The Art of Fugue in the early 1750s, the only further publications prior to the 1790s were the settings of Bach's four-part chorales. In 1758 Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg was the first to start preparing a published edition of Bach's four-part chorales, but in 1763 was prevented by royal duties. C. P. E. Bach, who owned the original manuscripts, then set about the same task, producing two volumes in 1765 and 1769. Dissatisfied with his publisher Friedrich Wilhelm Birnstiel, he surrendered the manuscript rights in 1771 to Johann Kirnberger and his patron Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia. From 1777 onwards, Kirnberger unsuccessfully made requests to Birnstiel and a new publisher, Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf, to publish the chorales. Following Kirnberger's death in 1783, C.P.E. Bach approached Breitkopf, who published them in four volumes between 1784 and 1787.\nAbout half of the chorale harmonisations in this collection have their origin in other extant works by Bach.\n\n\n== History ==\nBach's posthumous publications in the second half of the eighteenth century, like those printed during his life, gave the impression of a readership aimed at connoisseurs with a \"learned\" expertise in keyboard music. Thus only The Art of the Fugue and the four-part chorales were available in print prior to 1800. The demand in that period was partly affected by publishers' printing expenses and partly by changing tastes.",

He did so because the ice hockey club was $75 in debt and the team was being offered $400 for the cost of expenses for the trip. Because the trip would take place during the school term, and because Columbia University policy prohibited any person or team with an outstanding debt from taking place in a public contest, permission for the trip was denied. Unfortunately the team had already committed itself to participating by signing a contract. As a result, when the team attempted to back out of the trip the Pittsburgh management threatened to sue.

His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled that Beckham had not served a full first term and so was eligible to run.\n\n\n== General election ==\nBeckham's record of reconciliation and of supporting non-controversial reforms prevented significant opposition when he won the party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Belknap touted his business management experience, contrasting it with charges that Governor Beckham had mismanaged the state's eleemosynary institutions. Belknap lacked name recognition outside Louisville; he was a poor public speaker and unable to make the race truly competitive. The New York Times reported that Belknap was \"an athlete as well as a politician and a millionaire businessman\".\nElection day was a rowdy one throughout Kentucky as a judge supporting Belknap was shot by a sheriff at a polling place in Louisville.",

However, he was a student at Dartmouth College during the 1905–06 academic year, and upon his hiring to coach Vermont football for the 1908 season, it was noted that he had been coach at New Hampshire for the prior two years (1906 and 1907).

Crick had also been expelled from the Legislative Assembly for outrageous behaviour in the chamber, however he was returned in the resulting by-election.\nThe Royal Commission handed down an interim report in May 1906, which found that 50% of the sums received by a land agent Peter Close were paid to Crick whilst he was Minister for Lands. The Legislative Assembly proposed to immediately deal with Crick, however the Speaker ruled that the Assembly could not deal with the matter as it might prejudice his criminal trial. Instead the assembly amended its standing orders and suspended Crick pending the outcome of his criminal trial. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, and the Attorney General declined to prosecute the matter again as evidence before the Royal Commission had been ruled inadmissible in his criminal trial. Crick then submitted his resignation from parliament, however before it was accepted the assembly passed a motion that he was guilty of conduct that rendered him ineligible to sit as a member.

The AFL, which was largely run by skilled male workers, had little interest in organizing workers such as those the majority of those employed at the Marston Woolen Mills. Despite this lack of interest from the country's largest labor federation, more than 11,000 women went on strike in Maine alone between 1881 and 1900. Conditions for women textile workers were horrible and they, like their male counterparts, sought \"more and better boarding houses, cleaner drinking water, more and safer fire escapes, private and sanitary bathroom facilities, higher wages, equal pay for equal work, and unions to represent women’s interests.\" \nThis particular strike was directly precipitated by a rescinded wage increase in early January 1907 as well as the firing of Mamie Bilodeau, a 17 year old worker who complained of sexual harassment by an overseer named Charles North. Workers demanded \"an increase in wages, the dismissal of an overseer they accused of sexual harassment, the abolition of fines for workers, and workers’ representation on an arbitration committee.\"\n\n\n== Strike ==\nOn January 21, 225 workers, most of whom were women, walked out of the mill and went on strike. The Kennebec Journal reported that the strike began \"when a young woman employed as a sewer was discharged...\" After negotiation with the company, a mass meeting of strikers voted to return to work on April 13. The Kennebec Journal reported \"a general feeling of rejoicing in town [now] that the strike, the longest ever known in industrial Skowhegan, is now a thing of the past.\" Overall, strikers won the end of fines for imperfect work, the abolition of pay by piece work, recognition for a union-elected grievance committee and reinstatement of forty-two workers who had been fired for union activity.

All contemporary 46 states were part of the 1908 United States presidential election. State voters chose nine electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nFollowing the passage of a new constitution in 1898, Louisiana became a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. The Republican Party became moribund due to the disenfranchisement of blacks and the complete absence of other support bases as Louisiana completely lacked upland or German refugee whites opposed to secession. Despite this absolute single-party dominance, non-partisan tendencies remained strong among wealthy sugar planters in Acadiana, within the business elite of New Orleans, and even amongst the “lily-white” faction of the moribund state GOP that supported black disenfranchisement in the effort to become respectable amongst the white elite.\nFollowing disfranchisement, the state’s politics became dominated by the Choctaw Club of Louisiana, generally called the “Old Regulars”. This political machine was based in New Orleans and united with Black Belt cotton planters. Although white Republicans continued to work towards taking over Federal patronage from the “black and tans”, throughout most of the 1900s Louisiana politics was under firm Choctaw control as the Populist movement weakened with the disenfranchisement of many poor whites via the poll tax.\nLouisiana was won by the Democratic nominees, former Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate John W.

The average pay for a white firemen was $1.75 per day, while African American firemen were paid $1.25 per day. Furthermore, the railroad allowed full seniority rights to the African American firemen, but denied them the opportunity to be promoted to the position of railroad engineer. The effect of this was that many of the African American workers accumulated more seniority than their white firemen counterparts, allowing them the choice of more profitable runs.\nBy early 1909, tensions began to rise among the white firemen of the Georgia Railroad, many of whom were members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (B of LF&E), an all-white labor union.",

The brigade continued to wear its Royal Warwicks cap badge, together with RA collar badges.

The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October. In June 1939, as the international situation deteriorated, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected gun positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, the units of Anti-Aircraft Command were fully mobilised at their war stations. 69th (Royal Warwickshire) AA Rgt was under the command of 34th (South Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, which controlled the Gun Defended Areas (GDAs) of Birmingham and Coventry.",

It was one of two rival Cup competitions played in that year due to disagreements between the reigning champion of the tournament, Club Ciclista de San Sebastián, and some of the clubs invited.\nThis was the \"unofficial\" competition, organised by the UECF (Unión Española de Clubes de Fútbol), in San Sebastián. Both its winner and that of the rival, the newly-created FEF (Federación Española de Fútbol), later Royal Spanish Football Federation (Spanish: Real Federación Española de Fútbol, RFEF) in Madrid played two months later, are currently recognised as official by the RFEF.\nThe final was contested by Athletic Bilbao (then known as Athletic Club) and Vasconia, and was held at Ondarreta Stadium, San Sebastián on 20 March 1910. Athletic won the trophy for the third time in their history after defeating Vasconia 1–0. The only goal of the game was scored by Remigio Iza.\nThe tournament is believed to have been the first time Athletic Bilbao wore what became their regular red-and-white striped jersey, having recently imported the first set of kit from England (along with a set for their sister club, later known as Atletico Madrid).",

Returning to school for his senior season was Jefferson Vincent who had to earn his way back onto the team through several cuts and a demotion to the second squad. The potent combination of Vincent and Magner turned out to be instrumental in Cornell's success for the year.\nThe Big Red opened with a three-game series against Yale for the second consecutive year, this time playing in Chicago. Though the games were close Cornell was able to win each match. Magner and Crassweller played particularly well while Vincent recorded a hat-trick in the second game. On their way back east Cornell stopped in Cleveland for a two-game series against local colleges, winning both handily. Vincent notched his second 3-goal game against Western Reserve but it was Magner who starred with 5 scores to his credit.\nCornell opened its conference slate against defending champion Princeton and downed the Tigers with Magner and Vincent each providing 2 goals.",

Harvard would play nine of their ten games at the Boston Arena and performed about as well as they had at the Harvard Stadium Rink the year before.\nWith the arena available to them Harvard scheduled five games early in the season against non-conference opponents and gave a strong showing. The Crimson won four of the matches and entered the conference season looking for revenge against Princeton. After dispatching Columbia Harvard welcomed the Tigers to the new home with a convincing win. Their next match turned out to be the game of the season when undefeated Cornell came to town.

With that goal in mind the Quakers sought to have a good season to prove that they belonged in the conference.

Over the winter break the team was to play a two-game series in Cleveland, however, no mention of the trip can be found in the University newspaper.\nA further game was scheduled in February against Army but that game was never played.

Dean Kalbfleisch, who had seen limited action the year before, took over the role and played well early in the year against non-IHA opponents. After the three-game series with Yale it was apparent that Kalbfleisch wasn't the same caliber as their former captain, however, the team's offense performed much better than they had the year before so there was hope that the Tigers could repeat.\nAfter starting league play with a win over an improved Columbia squad, Princeton was looking forward to the showdown with Harvard but first they would have to get past a Cornell that was undefeated on the season. Whether they were looking past the Big Red or not, Princeton came out flat, allowing Cornell to score the game's first four goals en route to a 1–4 defeat for the Tigers.

The Lions followed that up with a miraculous victory over Dartmouth; the greens jumped out to a 3–0 lead after the first half but the offence came alive in the second half. With Bates leading the way, Columbia scored five times and won 5–4, giving the Lions hope that they could finally break through for a championship.\nThe next game came against Princeton with the championship in the balance. While Yale had yet to play a game, Harvard had left the league, leaving the match between Columbia and Princeton as the deciding contest. Unfortunately the Tigers boasted the best player in college hockey and Hobey Baker led Princeton to a 6–3 victory. Bates was again a force for the Lions, recording a hat-trick, but the Tiger's offense was just too much to overcome. Columbia ensured themselves of a second-place finish when they defeated Yale in February and, despite losing the championship, the Lions were encouraged with the growth of the program over the previous two seasons.\nAn ill omen came later as despite possessing a good schedule, there was so little interest in the freshman hockey team that it was disbanded in mid-February.",

The offense was particularly anemic, failing to score more than one goal in half of their games.\nThe team was also faced with the disadvantage of not being able to play at home. Warm weather forced the Big Red to play all of their games away from Ithaca, though most were neutral-site games in Syracuse. Even with all of the difficulties, Cornell did not play terribly.

The team had reservations about the policies enacted by the operators of the St. Nicholas Rink, which delayed Harvard's entry into the conference for several years, but new policies forced the program to cease dealing with the rink, Because the IHA schedule was conducted almost entirely at the St. Nicholas Rink, Harvard had to withdraw from the league.\nDespite leaving, Harvard scheduled many of their former conference opponents for the 1911–12 season and were able to use their home rink, the Boston Arena, as the venue for most games. The Crimson had narrowly missed out on championships in the previous two seasons and were eager to prove that they were the cream of the college hockey crop. There was also a moment to promote ice hockey from a minor to a major sport for the university. The team's play over the course of the season would go a long way to furthering those efforts, but the Crimson couldn't have started much worse when they lost 1–4 to MIT, though they were missing many of their regular players.\nDue to the winter break, the Crimson had almost three weeks before their next game.",

The Tigers began their season just after the start of the winter break with a game against Williams. Princeton won the extraordinarily lopsided game 14–0 and the headed to Cleveland for a three-game series with Yale. As they had the year before, Princeton won two of the three games but through their first four games it was apparent that the Tigers had a budding star on their hands.\n\nSophomore Hobey Baker distinguished himself from the first game against Williams, scoring 6 goals and immediately becoming the focal point of the Princeton offense.

Shortly after the final cuts were announced and the lineup for the team was announce the team encountered a sizeable problem. The IHA had held a meeting regarding player eligibility (no freshman and only three years of eligibility in league games) to which Columbia could not immediately agree. The Columbia representative referred the matter to his faculty committee and the team would continue to play its IHA schedule in the interim. The operators of the St. Nicholas Rink, however, decided that since the matter had not been settled Columbia's place in the IHA was not stable enough to allow the team to practice at the rink. While Columbia choose to play games against the IHA opponents regardless of their place in the league, the Columbia athletic committee decided to uphold its own eligibility requirements (four years of eligibility) regardless of what the IHA rules were.

    "1913–14 Dartmouth men's ice hockey season": "The 1913–14 Dartmouth men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program.\n\n\n== Season ==\nDartmouth built upon their success the year before with three wins to open their season. Despite the demise of the Intercollegiate Hockey Association, The Greens had a chance to capture the Intercollegiate Championship if they could defeat the major powers. Their first test came against Princeton and while the team was able to withstand the assault from the Tigers, Dartmouth was unable to score in the game and lost 0–2. The team still had a chance for a title if they could get some help but, after dropping their next game to Harvard, Dartmouth saw their opportunity slip through their fingers.\nThe offense resurfaced when they began playing again in February and carried the team to four consecutive victories. The Greens ended the year as the third best team in the country (behind only the teams they could not defeat) while Clarence Wanamaker set a program record with 20 goals on the year.\nNote: Dartmouth College did not possess a moniker for its athletic teams until the 1920s, however, the university had adopted 'Dartmouth Green' as its school color in 1866.",

Soft ice and early-season jitters contributed to a less-than-stellar effort from the Crimson and they lost the match 1–3 while cycling through many of their alternate players. The loss was unfortunate but hardly damaging to their season. A bigger development was the continued and expanding interest of ice hockey for the student body. Undergraduates were so enamored with the idea of joining the team that a second squad of 34 men, completely separate from the Varsity and Freshman teams, was organized and a schedule arranged.\nAfter the rather poor effort in the B. A. A. game, Harvard exploded out of the gate against MIT and did not take the pressure off all game, ending with a dominant 11–1 victory. The convincing victory demonstrated how the good the team could be as they embarked on their first ever holiday trip over the winter break. They would play Syracuse HC and Ottawa each twice with the team being billeted at the home of team captain Willetts in nearby Skaneateles.\nThe trip started well with the team producing a solid win against the Syracuse Club, but afterwards the results turned sour.",

They continued the best of three series against both Harvard and Yale with the winner likely to be the best team in the nation. Baker, who had been team captain the year before, stepped to the side to allow fellow senior Wendel Kuhn to serve in that capacity though it was clear that Baker was still the best player on the team. Former team members Clarence Peacock and Cyril Ballin returned to serve as assistant coaches for the team.\nAfter several good practices the team opened their season against St. Paul's School, the alma mater of both Baker and Kuhn, and the speedy Baker demonstrated that he hadn't taken a step back with a double hat-trick in the 8–3 win. Over the holiday break the Tigers played defending Canadian champion Toronto, winning the game 5–2 behind Kuhn's 4-goal game. They then took on the Boston Athletic Association, who had already defeated Harvard, and again won, this time by a score of 4–3. Princeton lost Rolland Peacock to a knee injury in the second match but the pair of goals by Kuhn and Baker were enough to give the Tigers the win.",

While the plans got so far as hiring a contractor to begin designing the building, the Bulldogs would still have to use the temporary Yale Arena for the 1913–14 season, which had been improved by the addition of artificial ice.\nThe Arena was ready for its first practice on January 20 and just four days later, Yale hosted its first game against the St. Nicholas Hockey Club. Work was still being done on the Arena when the Elis welcomed Princeton to New Haven and gave the Tigers all they had. Yale scored first and held the powerful Princeton offence off the scoresheet in the first half, then extended their lead in the second.

The two teams agreed to play two 5-minute overtimes and, after Princeton score twice more in the first extra session, Yale began a furious attack but all shots were repelled and the Bulldogs fell 3–5.\nYale lost their next match to Dartmouth, also in double overtime, leaving the team hungry for a win against arch-rival Harvard.",

The first big test for the team was against defending champion Princeton, but the Tigers were missing far too many players from the previous year to put up much of a fight. With Harvard sailing towards a championship they were shocked in their very next game by Dartmouth. Without a second game against the Greens, Harvard could only hope that Dartmouth would lose to keep the championship dreams alive.\nA sterling performance from Wylde allowed Harvard to complete the season sweep of Princeton.",

Before it even began, however, the team received unwelcome news when the operators of the St. Nicholas Rink, still the principle arena for the university's teams, refused to allow the freshman squad to use the venue for either games or practices as they weren't expected to attract enough spectators to offset the cost. As a result, the freshman team was abandoned for the year. Despite the decision, Princeton's varsity squad was rounding into form towards the end of December and looked to be a challenger for the collegiate title.\nThe team began well, winning their first three games and taking two of three from Yale during their trip to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, second-leading scorer Willian Humphreys was injured during the series. While Princeton managed to defeat Dartmouth in their next game the team was criticized for over-passing. Their second game of the Intercollegiate league turned out worse as Harvard used the large size of the Boston Arena to their advantage and shut out the Tigers 3–0.",

Precipitated by previous strike action by linemen of Georgia Railway earlier that year, the strike began on September 30 and ended January 5 of the following year. The main goals of the strike included increased pay, shorter working hours, and union recognition. The strike ended with the operators receiving a wage increase, and subsequent strike action the following year lead to union recognition.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe streetcar strike followed a previous labor dispute regarding linemen of the Georgia Railway and Power Company earlier that year. In June, the linemen requested a ten percent wage increase from the company, which was refused. Following this, the linemen brought William Pollard of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) to the city to help organize a labor strike (a local of the IBEW in Atlanta had been established years earlier in 1890). On August 12, the linemen went on strike over the firing of five linemen, of whom three had union affiliations. The strike ended as the company agreed to reinstate the two non-union affiliated men and, while not recognizing the IBEW, did acknowledge the linemen's right to unionize.

    "1916 United States presidential election in Alabama": "The 1916 United States presidential election in Alabama took place on November 7, 1916, as part of the nationwide presidential election. State voters chose twelve representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nSince the 1890s, Alabama had been effectively a one-party state ruled by the Democratic Party. Disenfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and a large proportion of poor whites via poll taxes, literacy tests and extralegal violence had essentially eliminated opposition parties outside of Unionist Winston County and a few nearby northern hill counties that had been Populist strongholds. The only competitive statewide elections became Democratic Party primaries that were limited by law to white voters.\nUnlike the other Deep South states, however, soon after black disenfranchisement Alabama’s white Republicans made rapid efforts to expel blacks from the state Republican Party. For the 1904 Convention, President Theodore Roosevelt rejected this proposal, unlike in North Carolina where he acquiesced without opposition to the demands of Jeter Connelly Pritchard. Oscar D. Street was appointed state party boss as part of the pro-Taft “black and tan” faction in 1912, while Roosevelt planned “lily-whitism” for the South with his “Bull Moose” party after he broke from the GOP. Roosevelt’s personal popularity even in the overwhelmingly Democratic Deep South meant he easily outpolled Taft in the region, and in Alabama this led the pro-Taft Street to move the state GOP in a lily-white direction much earlier than any other Deep South state.\nWith President Wilson still popular, however, the shift to a lily-white Republican Party would have no effect on Alabama’s presidential voting. An early poll in August saw incumbent President Woodrow Wilson (D–New Jersey), running with incumbent Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, with 24 votes, against Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Charles Evans Hughes (R–New York), running with former Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks, with five votes.",

All 48 contemporary states participated in the 1916 United States presidential election. Voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nRepublican nominee and Supreme Court justice Charles Evans Hughes carried Delaware with 50.20% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee and incumbent president Woodrow Wilson, who won 47.78% of the vote. This election marks one of three times in the 20th century that the state voted for the losing candidate, along with 1932 and 1948.\nWilson was the first Democrat to win the presidency without Delaware since James K. Polk in 1844, and Hughes the first Republican to ever carry Delaware without winning the presidency.",
    "1916 United States presidential election in Kentucky": "The 1916 United States presidential election in Kentucky took place on November 7, 1916, as part of the 1916 United States presidential election. Voters chose thirteen representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEver since the Civil War, Kentucky had been shaped politically by divisions created by that war between secessionist, Democratic counties and Unionist, Republican ones, although the state as a whole leaned Democratic throughout this era and the GOP had carried the state only once – by a very narrow margin in 1896 when northern parts of the state were affected by hostility towards William Jennings Bryan, and state native John M. Palmer drew votes from the Democrats.\nUnlike the other former Confederate states, Kentucky was not able to disfranchise its relatively small black population which had shrunk significantly in the late nineteenth century due to migration out of the South, in the 1900s, and this helped the Republicans carry the governorship in 1907 and narrowly fail to do so in 1915. Reunited after the 1912 debacle between Taft and Roosevelt, the GOP under Charles Evans Hughes visited the state in September and thought it could win a substantial plurality. Wilson also visited Kentucky in September, though for a large part of the fall the Republicans continued to believe they possessed a chance of carrying Kentucky's thirteen electoral votes, after another campaign tour with Theodore Roosevelt. However, by the second week of October, polls were suggesting that Wilson would comfortably carry Kentucky. By the end of the month, polls suggested that Wilson had five-eighths of the vote over Hughes, which if maintained would have been the best Democratic performance in the state between 1872 and 1960.\nUltimately, Wilson carried the state by 5.41 percent, an improvement of around three points on the narrow victories of Alton B. Parker and William Jennings Bryan in Kentucky's previous three two-party contests, although much less than the final polls.",
    "1916 United States presidential election in Louisiana": "The 1916 United States presidential election in Louisiana took place on November 7, 1916 as part of the 1916 United States presidential election. Voters chose ten representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEver since the passage of a new constitution in 1898, Louisiana had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. The Republican Party became moribund due to the disenfranchisement of blacks and the complete absence of other support bases as Louisiana completely lacked upland or German refugee whites opposed to secession. Despite this absolute single-party dominance, non-partisan tendencies remained strong among wealthy sugar planters in Acadiana and within the business elite of New Orleans.\nFollowing disfranchisement, the state's politics became dominated by the Choctaw Club of Louisiana, generally called the “Old Regulars”. This political machine was based in New Orleans and united with Black Belt cotton planters. Opposition emerged in the north and west of the state vis the Socialist Party, who elected a few officials in Winn Parish between 1908 and 1912, and by the Industrial Workers of the World in the lumbering parishes of Imperial Calcasieu. This opposition was mortally weakened almost immediately after the 1912 election by the unresolved conflict between electoral and antipolitical strategies for reform. Stronger opposition came via the Progressive movement soon after, although this time in the southern sugarcane-growing parishes, where conflicts with President Wilson's Underwood-Simmons Act even allowed a Progressive Party member in Whitmell P. Martin to be elected to the Third Congressional District in 1914.",
    "1916 United States presidential election in Maryland": "The 1916 United States presidential election in Maryland took place on November 7, 1916, as part of the 1916 United States presidential election which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states. Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nWith its history as a slave state and substantial historic secessionist support, Maryland had been strongly Democratic during the Third Party System despite having Federalist and Whig tendencies under previous systems. However, hostility towards William Jennings Bryan’s free silver and Populist tendencies in the cities meant that the state shifted Republican in 1896 and became very close in subsequent elections during the “System of 1896”. Unlike former Confederate states and Oklahoma, Maryland did not succeed in disenfranchising its large black population despite several attempts, which helped the Republicans remain highly competitive in early twentieth-century state elections.\nThe previous three elections had seen Maryland as the strongest Democratic state outside the former Confederacy. Despite this, and the fact that four members of the state’s Progressive Party committee refused to endorse the reunified Republicans under Charles Evans Hughes, leading GOP Senator Reed Smoot said late in September that he was confident Maryland could go Republican, although the poll still suggested Wilson would win narrowly. Wilson did not campaign in the state at all, but Hughes’ campaign made a brief visit during the second week of October, which was not regarded as successful.\nTwo days before the poll, Maryland was regarded as doubtful, although there had been reports of a continued swing to Wilson a week previously. As it turned out, the earlier prediction proved the better guide, with Wilson winning by 8.02 percent for his strongest performance in any antebellum Union state, and becoming the first Democrat to win an absolute majority in Maryland since Grover Cleveland in 1892.",

In Mississippi, voters voted for electors individually instead of as a slate, as in the other states.\nMississippi was won by the Democratic nominees, incumbent Democratic President Woodrow Wilson and Vice President Thomas R.

    "1916 United States presidential election in North Carolina": "The 1916 United States presidential election in North Carolina took place on November 7, 1916, as part of the 1916 United States presidential election, which was held throughout all contemporary forty-eight states. Voters chose twelve representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nLike all former Confederate states, North Carolina would during its “Redemption” develop a politics based upon Jim Crow laws, disfranchisement of its African-American population and dominance of the Democratic Party. Unlike the Deep South, the Republican Party possessed sufficient historic Unionist white support from the mountains and northwestern Piedmont to gain a stable one-third of the statewide vote total in general elections even after blacks lost the right to vote. A rapid move following disenfranchisement to a completely “lily-white” state GOP also helped maintain Republican support amongst the state’s voters. Like Tennessee and Oklahoma, the relative strength of Republican opposition meant that North Carolina did not have statewide White primaries, although certain counties did use the White primary. Although with disfranchisement of blacks the state introduced a poll tax, it was less severe than any other former Confederate state.\nSince the tail end of the 1900s, proposals to reform what was recognized as an inefficient and regressive tax system had become the major issue in North Carolina, especially after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified.\nNeither candidate campaigned in the state, which had voted Democratic at every election since 1876. At no point was there any serious question of Wilson carrying the state.",
    "1916 United States presidential election in Tennessee": "The 1916 United States presidential election in Tennessee was held on November 7, 1916. Tennessee voters chose twelve representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nFor over a century after the Civil War, Tennessee was divided according to political loyalties established in that war. Unionist regions covering almost all of East Tennessee, Kentucky Pennyroyal-allied Macon County, and the five West Tennessee Highland Rim counties of Carroll, Henderson, McNairy, Hardin and Wayne voted Republican – generally by landslide margins – as they saw the Democratic Party as the “war party” who had forced them into a war they did not wish to fight. Contrariwise, the rest of Middle and West Tennessee who had supported and driven the state’s secession was equally fiercely Democratic as it associated the Republicans with Reconstruction. After the disfranchisement of the state’s African-American population by a poll tax was largely complete in the 1890s, the Democratic Party was certain of winning statewide elections if united, although unlike the Deep South Republicans would almost always gain thirty to forty percent of the statewide vote from mountain and Highland Rim support.\nIn the early 1910s, the state Democratic Party was divided over the issue of prohibition. One faction, known as the “Independent Democrats,” wanted the state's Four Mile Law (which banned the sale of liquor within four miles of any school) to apply statewide, while the other faction, known as the “Regular Democrats,” wanted the state's larger cities to be exempt from this law. In 1910, the Independent Democrats fled the party and formed a coalition, known as the “Fusionists,” with Republicans, helping to elect Governor Ben W. Hooper, although the Republicans did not gain at other levels. With the divisions within the Democratic Party temporarily healed in 1914, the major state issue was the control of Memphis political boss E. H. Crump, who had been arrested and ousted from power for violating state prohibition laws.",

It was the region's most destructive storm since at least the 1867 San Narciso hurricane; Consul General Christopher Payne and archaeologist Theodoor de Booy considered the 1916 storm as the archipelago's most damaging. Its peak intensity was equivalent to a Category 3 on the modern Saffir–Simpson scale. The storm began as a tropical depression southeast of Barbados on October 6, though little is known about the storm's origins or its developing stages; by the time its center was first located, the cyclone was already a hurricane and causing damage in the Virgin Islands. After forming, the storm moved northwest into the eastern Caribbean Sea and strengthened quickly. Rough seas were produced in the Windward Islands at Dominica and Saint Kitts as the storm passed nearby between October 7–8, damaging coastal villages.\nOn the evening of October 9, the hurricane traversed the Virgin Islands with an intensity equivalent to a Category 2 on the modern Saffir–Simpson scale, passing directly over Saint Croix and producing gusts as high as 160 mph (260 km/h). Of the Danish West Indies, Saint Thomas fared worst, with virtually every building sustaining damage. The island harbor suffered greatly and numerous ships were grounded or sunk.

That setback didn't deter them, however, as they won their next five intercollegiate matches, including Yale.\nA huge shock for the season was when Yale defeated Harvard in their best-of-three series and caused the three Intercollegiate Hockey League teams to tie for the conference title. The tie left the door open for Dartmouth but the loss to Harvard prevented the Greens from being able to claim a superior record. So long as Harvard could trump Dartmouth the Hanoverians could not claim the championship despite a 6–1 intercollegiate record, the best in the nation.\nNote: Dartmouth College did not possess a moniker for its athletic teams until the 1920s, however, the university had adopted 'Dartmouth Green' as its school color in 1866.",

After a second shutout, this time over Dartmouth, Harvard left its home rink for the first time to play Princeton. The Tigers played Harvard tough all game long, attacking the Harvard net whenever they could.

Just when it looked like overtime would be needed, Princeton captain Schoen scored the winning goal with 15 seconds to play, putting a wrench in the works for Harvard's championship hopes.\nBefore the rematch Harvard faced Queen's and were able to exact their revenge from a year before with a 5–1 victory.

In the riot, Javanese townspeople burned and looted the Chinese district, resulting in roughly 10 deaths and dozens of injuries, and causing half of the Chinese population of the city to flee to Semarang and other cities in Java.\n\n\n== Context ==\nThe riot in Kudus was not an isolated incident, but happened in a context of anti-colonial resistance in the Dutch East Indies by organizations such as the Sarekat Islam, the rise of Chinese nationalism, rapid social change, and a breakdown of the traditional relationship between the Chinese Indonesians and the Javanese population. As the Chinese in the Indies often acted as middlemen between the Indonesians and the Dutch, they were also vulnerable to attacks and bullying which were aimed at the colonial economy or social injustice. \nAn Indonesian historian who wrote a thesis about the Kudus riot, Masyhuri, stated that the immediate factors that contributed to the riot were the particularly strong religious attitude of Muslims in Kudus, and the rise of far left radicalism which he believes primed the Muslim townspeople for radical action. He notes that\nmost Dutch sources blamed the Sarekat Islam, which he rejected as an oversimplification that may have come from their dislike of that organization. On the other hand, The Siauw Giap, who wrote a 1966 article on the Kudus riot, believed that there were systematic preconditions for anti-Chinese violence in Indonesian history which could spill over when conditions were right. In this case he partly blamed the very recent economic competition in the kretek cigarette industry between Chinese and Indonesian owners for the breakdown in relations in Kudus. \nThe incident that precipitated the riot itself happened the day before. In late October 1918, the\nKudus Chinese community had been holding ritual processions through the city to honour a folk religious figure\nTua Pek Kong in the hopes of warding off the Influenza epidemic ravaging the city.",

The decade between 1911 and 1921 was the only census period in which India's population fell, mostly due to devastation of the Spanish flu pandemic. The death toll in India's British-ruled districts was 13.88 million.\nThe pandemic broke out in Bombay in June 1918,  with one of the possible routes being via ships carrying troops returning from the First World War in Europe. The outbreak then spread across the country from west and south to east and north, reaching the whole of the country by August.

    "1918–19 Army Cadets men's ice hockey season": "The 1918–19 Army Cadets men's ice hockey season was the 16th season of play for the program.\n\n\n== Season ==\nWith World War I having ended in November, many students who had graduated early returned to West Point to finish their studies. Among these was Henry Nichols, who returned for a second season as the captain of the ice hockey team and helped the squad transition into the post-war years. Additionally, the team was again coached by a young officer, this time by Philip Day.\nBecause of how recent the end of the war was at the start of the season, many programs played a partial schedule if any at all. Army, however, was able to put together a slate of 9 games. Unfortunately, before the first match occurred, warm weather rendered Stuart Rink unusable and the team was forced back onto Lusk Reservoir. Even that didn't stop several matches from being cancelled, including the much-anticipated meetings with Yale and Princeton. To make matters worse, Nichols was ruled medically unfit to play and had to watch from the sidelines as his team struggled through the season. He was replaced in goal by Henry Burgard, who played aptly but could not help the Cadets' anemic offense.",

Because the Boston Arena had been damaged by a fire just before the season began, the teams were forced to play at the much smaller Charlesbank Rink.\nNote: Boston College's athletic programs weren't known as the 'Eagles' until 1920.",

With a transatlantic flight having yet to be completed, the weeks-long sea crossing was the quickest way to return home. It was no mean feat for Harvard to play its first hockey game exactly two months after the ceasefire, but the team was aided by the informal team that had played during the previous winter.\nThe ice hockey team had to overcome an additional hardship due to their home rink, the Boston Arena, having been seriously damaged by fire shortly after the War ended. On short notice the team was able to secure the Charlesbank Rink for three games, so named due it being located on the banks of the Charles River, near where the Daly Memorial Rink currently sits (as of 2020). The team played the Boston Hockey Club on January 11 and swiftly surrendered two goals to their opponents. Harvard redoubled their efforts to cut the lead in half before the end of the half and then allowed Avery to score twice in the second half to complete his hat-trick earn the win for the Crimson.\nIt would be almost three weeks before the team would play their next game, but by that time they had settled on a captain.

It would be the first season of soccer following a three-year hiatus due to World War I in which approximately ninety percent of registered players were enlisted in the Australian Defence Force prior to the 1916 season. Only 'Victorian Division 1' was contested. The calendar season also saw the eighth tournament of the Dockerty Cup, in which Footscray Thistle were crowned winners after defeating the newly established Windsor 2–0.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nFollowing the effects of World War I, four clubs disbanded from Division 1 at the conclusion of the 1915 season, and at least three clubs in Division 2 also disbanded. Burns, St Kilda and Prahran City from Division 1 all survived the economic effects of the hiatus but did not return immediately for 1919. Eight clubs competed in Division 1, with six clubs continuing from 1915 along with the debut of St David's and the default promotion of Windsor from Division 2. It is believed that there was no final series in this season.",

While that amounted to just 7 games that was still more than they had played over the previous two seasons combined. After beginning with a win over the Yankee Division Club team, BC dropped a three overtime game to Massachusetts Agricultural College, one of the top second-tier schools. Ten days later the team lost again, this time to MIT after the rematch with MAC had to be scrubbed.\nThe losses lit a fire under the players who ran roughshod over their next three opponents, posting three consecutive shutouts. Even when they did finally surrender a goal, BC refused to lose for the remainder of the season and finished with a 6–2 record. Despite the success, former team captain Walter Falvey stepped down as head coach after the season.\nNote: Boston College's athletic programs weren't known as the 'Eagles' until 1920.",

The Greens opened their intercollegiate season with two shutout victories over Tufts but when they encountered Harvard the teams fought a pitched battle for supremacy of the 1920 season. The score was close but Dartmouth fell 3–4. Harvard won all of its remaining games and claimed the intercollegiate championship. The Greens continued to play well against collegiate opponents, surrendering only a single goal over their next four games to finish with an impressive record. Dartmouth was runner-up for the championship once more, and while that could have presaged good things in the near future, head coach Clarence Wanamaker resigned from his position at the end of the season.\nNote: Dartmouth College did not possess a moniker for its athletic teams until the 1920s, however, the university had adopted 'Dartmouth Green' as its school color in 1866.",

First, however, they would have to overcome a few difficulties. Alfred Winsor, the coach who had instilled a tremendous defensive system and led the team to 7 intercollegiate championships, would not return to the program. The team decided to hire another Crimson grad with William Henry Claflin Jr. becoming the second coach in team history. Secondly, with the Boston Arena still undergoing repairs due to a fire, the university would have to find a new home for the year. With the St. Nicholas Rink now closed for hockey and the opening of the Philadelphia Ice Palace delayed, Harvard was able to secure the small Cambridge Ice Pavilion for many of its early games.\nDue to the small size of the rink, all games that took place there were restricted to six players on each side, rather than the normal seven for college games. Additionally, many of the game were played using three 15-minute periods rather than two 20-minute halves.",

The opportunities and opponents for the Tigers were also expanding, however, college ice hockey was still encountering the same problem it always had; lack of available ice.\nPrinceton spent a week in Concord, New Hampshire at the St. Paul's School facility which they were able to use to prepare for the start of their season. When they hit the ice in January they played at the Pavilion rink in Cambridge because the Boston Arena had been partially destroyed in a fire and was being rebuilt. The rink was so small that teams were forced to play with 6 players aside for the entire contest. Though they played well the Tigers fell 4–5. The following night Princeton was dominated by Toronto and, despite allowing 11 goals, Maxwell was noted as having played particularly well in the game.\nPoor weather caused delays in the construction of the Philadelphia Ice Palace which caused several of the team's games to be rescheduled.",

    "191st Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery": "191st Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery, was an air defence unit of Britain's Territorial Army formed in Birmingham before World War II. It defended the West Midlands against attack during the Battle of Britain, and was then shipped to Malta, where it served through most of the long siege when the island fortress was bombed incessantly.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nIn the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of Territorial Army (TA) infantry units into AA gun units of the Royal Artillery (RA). The Birmingham-based 6th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment was one unit selected for this role, becoming 69th (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery, on 10 December 1936, consisting of four batteries, including 191 AA Battery. The brigade continued to wear its Royal Warwicks cap badge, together with RA collar badges. The newly converted 191 AA Bty established Battery Headquarters (BHQ) at Fernbank House, Alum Rock Road. (From 1 January 1939, RA gun 'brigades' (such as the 69th) were termed regiments.)\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\n\n=== Mobilisation and Phoney War ===\n\nThe TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October. In June 1939, as the international situation deteriorated, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, the units of Anti-Aircraft Command were fully mobilised at their war stations. 69th (Royal Warwickshire) AA Rgt was under the command of 34th (South Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, which controlled the Gun Defended Areas (GDAs) of Birmingham and Coventry.",

    "1920 United States presidential election in Illinois": "The 1920 United States presidential election in Illinois took place on November 2, 1920, as part of the 1920 United States presidential election. State voters chose 29 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nA strongly Democratic state during the Second Party System, Illinois became Republican-leaning after the American Civil War due to a combination of strong Free Soil Party heritage amongst its Yankee northern counties with the wartime conversion of some Virginian-settled rock-ribbed Democratic Southern Illinois counties to Unionist Republicanism à la Appalachia. Between the Civil War and World War I, partisanship in Illinois – like in the Border States – largely re-fought the war, with the result that although the Democratic Party gained at least 43 percent of the statewide vote via Southern and German Catholic support in every election up to 1900, they never gained an absolute majority and carried the state's electoral votes only in 1892.\nDue to the Democratic Party's growing Populist and prohibitionist leanings, a decline in Democratic support after 1900 in its German Central Illinois strongholds transformed Illinois into a powerfully Republican state at all levels. Even Woodrow Wilson in 1912 when the GOP was mortally divided carried the state by only a very narrow margin. Harding's managers were always confident he would carry Illinois as all but three GOP nominees had since that party was formed. However, actual polls in Illinois vacillated, with a straw ballot in The Farm Journal even placing Cox at 45 percent in this strong Republican state. As election day neared, estimates of a Republican plurality of “at least 264,000” were made via a national survey of newspaper editors.\nAs it turned out, the editorial estimate was shown extremely conservative by the very earliest reports on polling day, which showed Harding winning by three-to-one.",
    "1920 United States presidential election in Kentucky": "The 1920 United States presidential election in Kentucky took place on November 2, 1920, as part of the 1920 United States presidential election. Voters chose thirteen representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEver since the Civil War, Kentucky had been shaped politically by divisions created by that war between secessionist, Democratic counties and Unionist, Republican ones, although the state as a whole leaned Democratic throughout this era and the GOP had carried the state only once – by a very narrow margin in 1896 when northern parts of the state were affected by hostility towards William Jennings Bryan, and state native John M. Palmer drew votes from the Democrats.\nIn 1919, however, Kentucky saw a significant change as the Republicans won not merely the governorship via Edwin P. Morrow but also control of the state legislature. However, there was a thought at the time that the triumph was partly a reflection of Morrow's own personal popularity.\nThe state legislature would ratify the Nineteenth Amendment on January 6, 1920, by more than three-to-one in both houses, and Kentucky would – alongside North Carolina which was abolishing its poll tax – observe the largest mobilization of new voters in the entire Union, and possibly the largest mobilization of female voters anywhere.\nDespite the extreme hostility to outgoing President Wilson, Democratic nominee and Ohio Governor James M. Cox – who originated in Butler County, Ohio just across the state line – was supported powerfully by Fayette County political boss Billy Kair, and alongside the mobilization of female voters noted above, this caused Kentucky to lead the nation in turnout. With this high turnout and Kair's powerful support of Governor Cox, the Democrats were able to carry Kentucky by 0.44 percent or 4,017 votes, in spite of Cox losing Tennessee and all the other Border States to Ohio Senator and Republican nominee Warren G. Harding, who nationally won the largest popular-vote margin on record. Alongside North Carolina, Kentucky was the state which most resisted the Republican landslide, with Cox falling by only 3 percent from Woodrow Wilson’s 1916 vote share.",
    "1920 United States presidential election in Louisiana": "The 1920 United States presidential election in Louisiana took place on November 2, 1920 as part of the 1920 United States presidential election. Voters chose ten representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEver since the passage of a new constitution in 1898, Louisiana had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. The Republican Party became moribund due to the disenfranchisement of blacks and the complete absence of other support bases as Louisiana completely lacked upland or German refugee whites opposed to secession. Despite this absolute single-party dominance, non-partisan tendencies remained strong among wealthy sugar planters in Acadiana and within the business elite of New Orleans.\nFollowing disfranchisement, the state’s politics became dominated by the Choctaw Club of Louisiana, generally called the “Old Regulars”. This political machine was based in New Orleans and united with Black Belt cotton planters. Opposition began to emerge with the Progressive movement in the 1910s, chiefly in the southern sugar-growing parishes, where conflicts with President Wilson’s Underwoood-Simmons Act even allowed a Progressive Party member in Whitmell P. Martin to be elected to the Third Congressional District in 1914. Continued opposition to the Choctaws would elect the reformer John M. Parker, originally part of Theodore Roosevelt’s Bull Moose Party, as governor at the beginning of 1920.\nDuring the second term of President Wilson, the Acadian parishes became even more upset with him because of his deep disagreements with Georges Clemenceau, as well as continued problems with the issue of sugar tariffs..There was also strong opposition is this part of Louisiana to the Nineteenth Amendment, and also substantial opposition in the Black Belt of the state because it was believed that enfranchising women could interfere with lily-white politics.",
    "1920 United States presidential election in Maryland": "The 1920 United States presidential election in Maryland took place on November 2, 1920, as part of the 1920 United States presidential election which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states. Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nWith its history as a slave state and substantial historic secessionist support, Maryland had been strongly Democratic during the Third Party System despite having Federalist and Whig tendencies under previous systems. However, hostility towards William Jennings Bryan’s free silver and Populist tendencies in the cities meant that the state shifted Republican in 1896 and became very close in subsequent elections during the “System of 1896”. Unlike former Confederate states and Oklahoma, Maryland did not succeed in disenfranchising its large black population despite several attempts, which helped the Republicans remain highly competitive in early twentieth-century state elections.\nWoodrow Wilson had carried Maryland by 4.84 percentage points more than his national margin in 1916, which made it his best state outside the former Confederacy or West. Democratic nominee and former Ohio Governor James M. Cox did not campaign in the state, but Republican nominee and Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, fearing that Cox might add the machine-controlled states of the Northeast to his “Solid South”, did campaign in Maryland during September. The first straw vote in mid-October showed Harding leading by around 300 votes out of 4,300, although that had reversed in a poll a week later, and at the end of October polls were divided with one giving the state to Cox but another saying that it would be safe for Harding if black women could be mustered to vote.\nAs it turned out, Harding carried the state comfortably: his margin was comparable to the other border states except Kentucky (where Cox was helped by Fayette County political boss Billy Kair) but Maryland was still 13.22 points more Democratic than the nation at-large or an 8 percent bigger differential than in 1916.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Results by county ===\n\n\n==== Counties that flipped from Democratic to Republican ====\nAnne Arundel\nBaltimore (City)\nBaltimore (County)\nCarroll\nDorchester\nFrederick\nHarford\nHoward\nPrince George's\nSt.",

Voters chose 10 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. In Mississippi, voters voted for electors individually instead of as a slate, as in the other states.\nMississippi voted for the Democratic nominee, Governor James M.

Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNebraska voted strongly for Republican nominee, Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio, over the Democratic nominee, Governor James M. Cox of Ohio. Harding ran with Governor Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts, while Cox ran with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York. Harding won every county in the state, although the trend – dramatic as it was – was substantially smaller than Harding's landslides in heavily German-American North and South Dakota. This was the first time since 1904 that Nebraska voted Republican in a presidential election.",
    "1920 United States presidential election in North Carolina": "The 1920 United States presidential election in North Carolina took place on November 2, 1920, as part of the 1920 United States presidential election, which was held throughout all contemporary forty-eight states. Voters chose twelve representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nLike all former Confederate states, North Carolina would during its “Redemption” develop a politics based upon Jim Crow laws, disfranchisement of its African-American population and dominance of the Democratic Party. Unlike the Deep South, the Republican Party possessed sufficient historic Unionist white support from the mountains and northwestern Piedmont to gain a stable one-third of the statewide vote total in general elections even after blacks lost the right to vote. Although with disfranchisement of blacks the state introduced a poll tax, it was less severe than other former Confederate states with the result that a greater proportion of whites participated than anywhere else in the South. A rapid move following disenfranchisement to a completely “lily-white” state GOP also helped maintain Republican support amongst the state’s voters. Like Virginia, Tennessee and Oklahoma, the relative strength of Republican opposition meant that North Carolina did not have statewide White primaries, although certain counties did use the White primary.\nAlthough North Carolina had never given women suffrage rights at any level of government before 1919, nor did its legislature consider the Nineteenth Amendment when it passed the Federal House and Senate, during 1920 the state passed by more a more than three-to-one margin a constitutional amendment that made it the first former Confederate state to abolish its poll tax. This amendment was first proposed as early as 1908, but was only given serious thought by the state legislature after the Sixteenth Amendment took effect in 1913 and it was recognized that North Carolina was burdened with an inefficient and regressive tax system. The abolition of the poll tax and women's suffrage, as it turned out, would cause in North Carolina amongst the largest mobilizations of new voters in the Union.",
    "1920 United States presidential election in Oklahoma": "The 1920 United States presidential election in Oklahoma took place on November 2, 1920, as part of the 1920 United States presidential election which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states. Voters chose ten representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nIn its early years, Oklahoma was a “Solid South” Democratic state whose founding fathers like \"Alfalfa Bill\" Murray and Charles N. Haskell had disfranchised most of its black population via literacy tests and grandfather clauses, the latter of which would be declared unconstitutional in Guinn v. United States. Partly owing to the absence of the poll taxes found in other Southern states due to the strength of populism amongst the state’s white settlers, the state became a stronghold of the Socialist Party in the 1910s, especially in the southeast and the northwestern Plains.\nHowever, despite being less stridently isolationist than states further north in the Great Plains, Oklahoma was nonetheless caught up in the hostility towards President Wilson and his various foreign policy proposals, as well as his inability to deal with large-scale domestic conflict. In early polls this was thought insufficient to split the state from the “Solid South”, but as it turned out a large swing caused the Democrats to lose the state, alongside Tennessee, for the first break in the “Solid South” since Reconstruction. The Republicans also elected a Senator and five Congressmen, so strong was the hostility towards Wilson.\nOklahoma voted for the Republican nominee, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, over the Democratic nominee, Ohio Governor James M. Cox and Socialist nominee Eugene V. Debs of Indiana. Harding ran with Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, while Cox ran with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York and Debs ran with Seymour Stedman of Illinois.",
    "1920 United States presidential election in Tennessee": "The 1920 United States presidential election in Tennessee took place on November 2, 1920, as part of the 1920 United States presidential election. Tennessee voters chose 12 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nFor over a century after the Civil War, Tennessee was divided according to political loyalties established in that war. Unionist regions covering almost all of East Tennessee, Kentucky Pennyroyal-allied Macon County, and the five West Tennessee Highland Rim counties of Carroll, Henderson, McNairy, Hardin and Wayne voted Republican – generally by landslide margins – as they saw the Democratic Party as the “war party” who had forced them into a war they did not wish to fight. Contrariwise, the rest of Middle and West Tennessee who had supported and driven the state’s secession was equally fiercely Democratic as it associated the Republicans with Reconstruction. After the disfranchisement of the state’s African-American population by a poll tax was largely complete in the 1890s, the Democratic Party was certain of winning statewide elections if united, although unlike the Deep South Republicans would almost always gain thirty to forty percent of the statewide vote from mountain and Highland Rim support. When the Democratic Party was bitterly divided, the Republicans did win the governorship in 1910 and 1912, but did not gain at other levels.\nDuring the period before the 1920 presidential election, Tennessee was the center of bitter debate over the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, which the state – with its Democratic Party still seriously divided – ultimately passed by a very close margin, 50 to 46, in the House of Representatives.\nAlthough most of the Republicans in the state legislature had supported the Nineteenth Amendment, outgoing Democratic President Woodrow Wilson’s League of Nations was deeply unpopular in the isolationist and fundamentalist Appalachian regions, and the President was thus stigmatized for his advocacy of that organization. Democratic nominee James M. Cox also supported American participation in the League, whereas his rival Warren Harding was largely opposed to the League and was helped in the South by racial and labor unrest elsewhere in the country.",

Vernon compiled the best record in the PCL for a third consecutive seasons under manager Bill Essick. \nThe Tigers' championship was marred by revelations during the 1920 season of a gambling scandal involving first baseman Babe Borton. Borton admitted paying money during the 1919 pennant race to three players on the Salt Lake City Bees to throw games against the Tigers. Borton claimed that bribes had also been paid by a teammate to Portland and Seattle players, that the bribes were paid out of a pool of money funded by numerous teammates, and that the bribes were instigated by Vernor manager Bill Essick. Borton was released by the Tigers in August 1920 and never again played professional baseball.

It was organised by the National League of the Blind (NLB) to protest poor working conditions and poverty experienced by blind people. In particular the NLB raised concerns over the conditions in workshops run to provide employment to the visually impaired by various charities. The marchers assembled at Newport, Manchester and Leeds on 5 April and marched to London, assembling at Trafalgar Square on 25 April.  They were greeted by a crowd of 10,000 who listened to speeches from Herbert Morrison and trade union leaders. The march leaders met with prime minister David Lloyd George on 30 April, who made few promises apart from to pay for the marchers' rail tickets home.  A subsequent Blind Persons Act 1920, the first disability-specific legislation in the world, compelled local authorities to ensure the welfare of blind persons and reduced the pension age for blind men. The march served as inspiration for the more famous 1936 Jarrow March against unemployment, in which the NLB also participated.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nA trade union and pressure group, the National League of the Blind (NLB), was founded in 1894 to campaign for the rights of visually impaired persons; a founder-member, Ben Purse, became its first general secretary in 1897.

    "1920 in Victorian soccer": "The 1920 Victorian soccer season was the ninth competitive season of soccer in the Australian state of Victoria, under association with the governing body of Football Victoria. Only two conferences of the 'Victorian Division 1' were contested, which as of 2021 season is recognized as the NPL. The calendar season saw the ninth installment of the Dockerty Cup, but in the first time in its history the competition was abandoned shortly before the grand final, in which Albert Park was to verse Northumberland and Durham United.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nFollowing the 1919 season, Football Victoria and its clubs were still recovering from the effects of World War I. Division 1 grew from eight teams to twelve, with the return of Burns and St Kilda, along with the debuts of newly established clubs of Melbourne Welsh and Osborne House. As a result of twelve teams confirming their commitment for the season, the league was split into two conferences with a final series determining the champions. The series consisted of the premiers and runners up of the two conferences, with Northumberland and Durham United defeating St Kilda 2–0 in the grand final, being the first occasion in which a runner up team were to be crowned champions. This feat would be one of three first time occasions in the history of the league. The other two occasions consisted of the fact that a team finished undefeated but would not become premiers, with Osborne House playing less than half of the season, but won all four of its matches. The third first time occasion was Windsor becoming the first team to have a point deduction. Windsor would have been Conference B premiers but were penalized four points which resulted them in finishing third.",

Almost 5 km of the tramline was washed away and the Pope's Nose Creek bridge was badly damaged.\nAt Cossack the sea in the creek rose 7.2 m, covering the road and surrounding country for about a mile (1.6 km). Seven luggers and a schooner which had sheltered in Cossack Creek were lifted 100 m into the mangroves by the storm surge.\nNot a building was left unscathed in Roebourne. Residents sheltered in more substantial stone buildings as the timber houses were razed. The Jubilee Hotel was unroofed and the other two hotels badly damaged.",

    "1920–21 Columbia Lions men's ice hockey season": "The 1920–21 Columbia Lions men's ice hockey season was the 20th season of play for the program.\n\n\n== Season ==\nAfter resigning from the Intercollegiate Hockey Association in 1912 the ice hockey team had difficulties scheduling games due to no longer having the St. Nicholas Rink as a venue. The team was unable to play a single game in either 1916 or 1917 and while a group of students did manage to play four games during the 1917–18 season, it was done informally and not as representatives of Columbia University. In 1920 an effort was made to revive the team and the 181st Street Ice Palace was secured as a practice facility. Once enough interest had been demonstrated and a team was formed, manager A. L. Walker Jr. put together a tentative schedule.\nColumbia opened its season against Yale and, unsurprisingly for a team that hadn't played in six seasons, lost 5–7. The Lions took more than two weeks to play their next game and, once they did, they found themselves on a sheet of ice nearly double the size of their practice rink. In their game against Williams the team began well, leading 1–0 after the first, but slumped badly in the middle frame, allowing 5 goals and losing any chance they had at winning their first game of the season.",

With the Crimson now possessing a surface that could accommodate 7-on-7 hockey once more, as well as coach Clafin affirming his preference for the style, Harvard returned to its familiar style of play and began the season with a dominating win over King's College.\nThe results didn't change when Harvard began playing other US colleges and the Crimson ran roughshod over their competition. Jabish Holmes recorded four consecutive shutouts including matching 7–0 victories over rivals Princeton and Yale. The only thing that stopped Harvard from rolling to an undefeated season was a visit by the St. Patrick's Hockey Club of Ottawa, who won a pair of one-goal games in mid-February. Harvard seemed to take issue with the losses and thrashed their final two opponents, capping another championship season.\nPrinceton attempted to schedule a second game with Harvard at the Philadelphia Ice Palace but the Tigers were unsuccessful in their efforts. As a result, the single game between the two had to stand for the season series.",

Harvard, the leading program at the time, elected to only keep its arrangement with Princeton and Yale. As a result, plans for the league were changed to allow Harvard to participate; instead of a conference, the league would operate in a more informal manner that would facilitate scheduling between teams as well as to certify rules that all members could accept. With those modifications, Penn was able to join the Intercollegiate Ice Hockey Association of America with five of its contemporaries, but membership was not the stabilizing force that Penn hoped it would be.\nPenn had originally hoped to schedule a practice game before the winter break but no arrangement could be finalized. After Christmas the team was supposed to open the season on the 7th and 8 January, but both games were cancelled due to scheduling conflicts. In the end they were able to rope the St. Nicholas Hockey Club into a game on the 8th before playing their first intercollegiate game the following week.\nIn February Harvard finally accepted the inevitable and agreed to play 6-on-6 hockey beginning the following year. As a result the expectation was that the Intercollegiate league that had just been formed would become a fully-formed conference in the near future.",

Issues arose from some potential members, namely Harvard, and instead of a formal league a loose association was formed in order to discuss issues, settle arguments and facilitate scheduling.\nAfter Talbot Hunter's sudden departure from the team the program brought in former player Francis Bangs as coach. Unfortunately, the team was still having to use the Philadelphia Ice Palace as its home arena since the temporary rinks that were built on the Whitney Avenue tennis courts proved insufficient. After opening up with two losses before Christmas, Yale headed to Pittsburgh to face Carnegie Tech for the first time in over a decade. The Tartans had just brought their program back and were hardly a match for the experienced Bulldogs but the Tartans showed promise.\nYale won a third consecutive game against another program that returned after several years away (Columbia) but when they faced stiffer competition, the Elis were unable to raise their game. In their final five game of the season, Yale managed only 3 goals and surrendered 28. Their best performance came against Dartmouth when the two teams played a scoreless contest although the game was called due to poor ice conditions.",

The game was, unfortunately, a disaster for the Lions who were wholly unable to stop the Bulldog attack in a 10–2 loss. The next two contests, against Colgate and Princeton were both cancelled due to warm weather causing a lack of available ice, not an uncommon problem at the time. The extra practice served Columbia well as their next official game ended as a 4–3 overtime win over Princeton.\nAfter a close loss to Penn, the team took two weeks off to study for mid-term exams before returning in early February against Hamilton. After dropping the match Columbia headed to Hanover to play Dartmouth at their winter carnival but a snowstorm caused the game to be called part-way through the second period. Columbia finished their season with two convincing home wins (a further game against Army was cancelled) leaving the team with its first non-losing season in a decade. Unfortunately, the team struggled to sell tickets for those games, an ill omen for the future of the program.\nDouglas MacKay served as manager of the team until taking a job with the Winnipeg Tribune.",

    "1921–22 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season": "The 1921–22 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 24th season of play for the program.\n\n\n== Season ==\nBefore the season, Harvard finally accepted the trend of all other college teams and agreed to play 6-on-6 hockey for the year. Additionally, Harvard accepted the new practice of playing its two defenders side by sire rather than one in front of the other. The changes did little to hamper the Crimson in their first game, however, when they returned from their Christmas break the team had to quickly prepare for Toronto. The Blues were considered by many as the top amateur team in North America and they demonstrated why when they dominated Harvard to the tune of a 6–1 victory. Harvard was able to get much more practice time before their next game and when they faced Dalhousie they appeared much more themselves.\nThe Crimson didn't lose another game after the Toronto debacle, though they did tie two amateur clubs in the middle of their season. After wrapping up the Triangular League championship, Harvard put together an informal group of players, composed of members of both the varsity and freshman teams, and played an exhibition match with Boston College. The cross-town rivals won the game in overtime, but Harvard was missing both its starting goaltender and team captain, so there was little doubt as to which varsity squad was the better.",

The hiring of Clarence Wanamaker from Dartmouth brought about a resurgence for the program, not least of which because the Bulldogs returned to their expansive schedule that was characteristic of the team before World War I. In another return to form, the New Haven Arena began to host ice hockey games for the first time in years and Yale would finally have a local home after having to play as vagabonds since the start of the war.\nYale played inconsistently throughout the year, playing well in some games and poorly in others.

    "1923 Central American Treaty of Peace and Amity": "The 1923 Central American Treaty of Peace and Amity, officially known as the General Treaty of Peace and Amity, 1923, was a treaty signed by the five nations of Central America in 1923 which established that all nations would denounce and not recognize any government which arose in any of the five signatory nations through illegal means (ie: coup d'état, revolution). The treaty remained effective from its signing on 7 February 1923 until it was denounced by the Central American Court of Justice in 1934.\n\n\n== History ==\nA similar treaty was signed and ratified in the 1907 Central American Treaty of Peace and Amity but the treaty fell apart in 1917 when Nicaragua denounced the treaty.\nThe five nations of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua agreed to draft a new treaty with a similar function and were invited by United States President Warren G. Harding on 4 December 1922 to draft and sign the treaty in Washington D.C. The treaty outlined that no signatory nation would recognize any government which arose in any other signatory nation which rose to power via a revolution or a coup d'état. The treaty also outlawed the signing of any secret treaties between nations, outlawed radical changing of Constitutions, banned nations from intervening in civil wars, and reaffirming the legitimacy of the Central American Court of Justice. The treaty also placed limitations of military and naval armaments.\nThe United States did not sign the treaty, but did follow its terms as displayed when the it refused to recognize the change of government in El Salvador when General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez overthrew the democratically elected President, Arturo Araujo, on 2 December 1931. The United States' initial refusal to recognize Hernández Martínez's government, however, led to the eventual collapse of the treaty since in 1932, both Costa Rica and El Salvador denounced the treaty on 23 December and 26 December, respectively. Although El Salvador never ratified the treaty, Costa Rica did, leaving the treaty with only Guatemala and Nicaragua as its only legal adherents, since Honduras never ratified it either.\nIn 1934, the Central American Court of Justice denounced the treaty, effectively ending its legality in all five nations.",

    "1924 United States presidential election in Alabama": "The 1924 United States presidential election in Alabama took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the nationwide presidential election, which was held throughout all contemporary forty-eight states. Voters chose twelve representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nSince the 1890s, Alabama had been effectively a one-party state ruled by the Democratic Party. Disenfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and a large proportion of poor whites via poll taxes, literacy tests and informal harassment had essentially eliminated opposition parties outside of Unionist Winston County and a few nearby northern hill counties that had been Populist strongholds. The only competitive statewide elections became Democratic Party primaries that were limited by law to white voters. Unlike most other Confederate states, however, soon after black disenfranchisement Alabama’s remaining white Republicans made rapid efforts to expel blacks from the state Republican Party. Indeed under Oscar D. Street, who ironically was appointed state party boss as part of the pro-Taft “black and tan” faction in 1912, the state GOP would permanently turn “lily-white”, with the last black delegates from the state at any Republican National Convention serving in 1920.\nThe 1920 election, aided by isolationism in Appalachia and the whitening of the state GOP, saw the Republicans gain their best presidential vote share in Alabama since 1884, while the GOP even exceed forty percent in the House of Representatives races for the 4th, 7th and 10th congressional districts. However, isolationist sentiment in Appalachia would ease after the election of Warren G. Harding and funding issues meant the Republicans would not run a candidate for any Alabama congressional district in 1922.\nWith the ebbing of isolationist sentiment and a conservative Southern Democrat supportive of poll taxes and opposed to women’s suffrage in John W. Davis of West Virginia nominated after an extremely prolonged convention, neither Davis nor incumbent Republican President Calvin Coolidge nor “La Follette/Wheeler” candidate Robert M. La Follette visited Alabama.",
    "1924 United States presidential election in Delaware": "The 1924 United States presidential election in Delaware took place on November 4, 1924. All contemporary 48 states were part of the 1924 United States presidential election. State voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nDelaware was won by the Republican nominee, incumbent President Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts, over the Democratic nominee, Ambassador John W. Davis of West Virginia. Coolidge ran with former Budget Director Charles G. Dawes of Illinois, while Davis ran with Governor Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska. Also in the running that year was the Progressive Party nominee, Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin and his running mate Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana.\nAs of 2023, this is the most recent time a Republican won without carrying Kent County. This was also the last time until 2000 that an unsuccessful Democratic candidate was able to carry any of Delaware's counties.",
    "1924 United States presidential election in Illinois": "The 1924 United States presidential election in Illinois took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the 1924 United States presidential election. State voters chose 29 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nA strongly Democratic state during the Second Party System, Illinois became Republican-leaning after the American Civil War due to a combination of strong Free Soil Party heritage amongst its Yankee northern counties with the wartime conversion of some Virginian-settled rock-ribbed Democratic Southern Illinois counties to Unionist Republicanism à la Appalachia. Between the Civil War and World War I, partisanship in Illinois – like in the Border States – largely re-fought the war, with the result that although the Democratic Party gained at least 43 percent of the statewide vote via Southern and German Catholic support in every election up to 1900, they never gained an absolute majority and carried the state's electoral votes only in 1892.\nDue to the Democratic Party's growing Populist and prohibitionist leanings, a decline in Democratic support after 1900 in its German Central Illinois strongholds transformed Illinois into a powerfully Republican state at all levels. Even Woodrow Wilson in 1912 when the GOP was mortally divided carried the state by only a very narrow margin, and in 1920 hostility to the League of Nations and the perceived anti-German bias of both outgoing President Wilson and new Democratic nominee and former Ohio Governor James M. Cox – the latter of whom had banned German-language instruction in Ohio schools – meant Harding carried Illinois by over 42 percentage points and the state was his sixth strongest in a national landslide. German Catholic Clinton County, and twelve southern-settled counties in the Illinois River valley and southward, went Republican for the first time.\nDuring the Republican National Convention, Illinosian Charles G. Dawes easily won the Vice-Presidential nomination ahead of fellow state resident Frank Lowden. The first campaign in Illinois was not by Coolidge or Davis, but by radical third-party nominee, veteran Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette, who on July 4 confirmed his previous plan to run a third-party campaign when nominated by the \"Conference for Progressive Political Action\". La Follette on Labor Day, August 22, said he hoped to carry Illinois because he believed gubernatorial candidate Len Small would not aid the Coolidge ticket.",
    "1924 United States presidential election in Kentucky": "The 1924 United States presidential election in Kentucky took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the 1924 United States presidential election. Voters chose thirteen representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEver since the Civil War, Kentucky had been shaped politically by divisions created by that war between secessionist, Democratic counties and Unionist, Republican ones, although the state as a whole leaned Democratic throughout this era and the GOP had carried the state only once – in 1896 – between 1864 and 1920.\nHowever, largely owing to loss of support for the Democratic Party in historically secessionist Northern Kentucky, and to a general decline in Democratic support from the high levels seen in 1920, due to female mobilization after the Nineteenth Amendment, Calvin Coolidge narrowly won Kentucky by 2.95 points against John W. Davis, winning all 13 electoral votes from the state. Kentucky is the only state that Warren G. Harding lost in the 1920 presidential election, but Coolidge won in the 1924 presidential election.\nAlso on the ballot was maverick Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette, who carried his home state and ran second in eleven states in the Midwest and West. However, La Follette had little appeal in most of conservative Kentucky, with the only exceptions being a few rapidly unionising, labor-policy-conscious mining counties in the Eastern Coalfield and more significantly in German-influenced Northern Kentucky where he ran ahead of Davis in traditionally Democratic, highly populated Kenton and Campbell Counties – in the process playing a decisive role in handing Coolidge a closely contested election. Despite his strong showings in the two northern counties, Kentucky was overall La Follette's seventh-weakest state and, outside the former Confederacy where poll taxes prevented most of the lower classes voting, his second-weakest after pro-League of Nations Rhode Island.",
    "1924 United States presidential election in Louisiana": "The 1924 United States presidential election in Louisiana took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the 1924 United States presidential election, which was held throughout all contemporary forty-eight states. Voters chose ten representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEver since the passage of a new constitution in 1898, Louisiana had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. The Republican Party became moribund due to the disenfranchisement of blacks and the complete absence of other support bases as Louisiana completely lacked upland or German refugee whites opposed to secession. Despite this absolute single-party dominance, non-partisan tendencies remained strong among wealthy sugar planters in Acadiana and within the business elite of New Orleans.\nFollowing disfranchisement, the state's politics became dominated by the Choctaw Club of Louisiana, generally called the “Old Regulars”. This political machine was based in New Orleans and united with Black Belt cotton planters. Opposition began to emerge with the Socialist Party in the lumbering parishes in the late 1900s, and more seriously with the Progressive movement, chiefly in the southern sugar-growing parishes, in the 1910s. Conflicts with President Wilson's Underwoood-Simmons Act allowed a Progressive Party member in Whitmell P.

    "1924 United States presidential election in North Carolina": "The 1924 United States presidential election in North Carolina took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the 1924 United States presidential election, which was held throughout all contemporary forty-eight states. Voters chose twelve representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nAs a former Confederate state, North Carolina had a history of Jim Crow laws, disfranchisement of its African-American population and dominance of the Democratic Party in state politics. However, unlike the Deep South, the Republican Party had sufficient historic Unionist white support from the mountains and northwestern Piedmont to gain a stable one-third of the statewide vote total in most general elections A rapid move following disenfranchisement to a completely “lily-white” state GOP also helped maintain Republican support amongst the state’s voters. Like Virginia, Tennessee and Oklahoma, the relative strength of Republican opposition meant that North Carolina did not have statewide white primaries, although certain counties did use the white primary.\nIn 1920, with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, North Carolina became the first former Confederate state to abolish its poll tax, which when in force was less severe than other former Confederate states with the result that more whites participated. In that election North Carolina would, alongside Kentucky, see the largest mobilisation of female voters in the entire country. Despite some thought that Republican nominee Harding might threaten to carry the state, in fact North Carolina showed the smallest swing against the Democrats of any state in the Union.\nDuring the prolonged Democratic Party primaries, North Carolina shifted its delegates between William Gibbs McAdoo, Virginian Carter Glass, and Alabamian Oscar W. Underwood, except for a few votes for favorite son George Gordon Battle. Ultimately neither McAdoo nor New York Governor Al Smith – who represented the immigrant, anti-Prohibition wing of the party – could prove acceptable to all Democratic delegates and the nomination went to a compromise candidate in Wall Street lawyer John W. Davis of West Virginia.",
    "1924 United States presidential election in Oklahoma": "The 1924 United States presidential election in Oklahoma took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the 1924 United States presidential election which was held throughout all contemporary forty-eight states. Voters chose ten representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nIn its early years, Oklahoma was a “Solid South” state whose founding fathers like \"Alfalfa Bill\" Murray and Charles N. Haskell had disfranchised most of its black population via literacy tests and grandfather clauses, the latter of which would be declared unconstitutional in Guinn v. United States. In 1920 this “Solid South” state, nonetheless, joined the Republican landslide of Warren G. Harding, electing a GOP senator and five congressmen, but in 1922 the Democratic Party returned to their typical ascendancy as the state GOP became bitterly divided.\nAlso in the running was the Progressive Party nominee, Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin and his running mate Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, though they ran under the Farmer-Labor Party label in Oklahoma. Despite problems in the state's agricultural sector, La Follette did not have the appeal in Oklahoma he had in more northerly areas of the Plains. Isolationism was weaker in this heavily Southern, Protestant state and Bryan-era pietist Democratic support struck a different cultural vein from La Follette's largely Catholic and Lutheran backers. Unlike the Bryanites, La Follette's base strongly opposed the Ku Klux Klan, which dominated politics in Oklahoma at the time, and was focused on farm cooperatives.\nOklahoma was won by Democratic nominee, Ambassador John W. Davis of West Virginia, over Republican nominee, incumbent President Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts.",
    "1924 United States presidential election in Tennessee": "The 1924 United States presidential election in Tennessee took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the 1924 United States presidential election. Tennessee voters chose 12 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nFor over a century after the Civil War, Tennessee was divided according to political loyalties established in that war. Unionist regions covering almost all of East Tennessee, Kentucky Pennyroyal-allied Macon County, and the five West Tennessee Highland Rim counties of Carroll, Henderson, McNairy, Hardin and Wayne voted Republican – generally by landslide margins – as they saw the Democratic Party as the “war party” who had forced them into a war they did not wish to fight. Contrariwise, the rest of Middle and West Tennessee who had supported and driven the state's secession was equally fiercely Democratic as it associated the Republicans with Reconstruction. After the disfranchisement of the state's African-American population by a poll tax was largely complete in the 1890s, the Democratic Party was certain of winning statewide elections if united, although unlike the Deep South Republicans would almost always gain thirty to forty percent of the statewide vote from mountain and Highland Rim support. When the Democratic Party was bitterly divided, the Republicans did win the governorship in 1910 and 1912, but did not gain at other levels.\nThe 1920 election saw a significant but not radical change, whereby by moving into a small number of traditionally Democratic areas in Middle Tennessee and expanding turnout due to the Nineteenth Amendment and powerful isolationist sentiment, the Republican Party was able to capture Tennessee's presidential electoral votes and win the governorship and take three congressional seats in addition to the rock-ribbed GOP First and Second Districts. In 1922, with the ebbing of isolationist sympathy and a consequent decline in turnout, the Democratic Party regained the three seats lost in 1920 and also regained Tennessee's governorship under Austin Peay, later to become notorious for attempting to prohibit the teaching of evolution.\nDuring the deeply divided Democratic presidential primaries and 1924 Democratic National Convention, Governor Peay was Tennessee's main representative Despite Tennessee's strong prohibitionist leanings and “Bible Belt” anti-Catholicism, it was thought popular Catholic New York Governor Al Smith would have to carry the state at this convention to win the Democratic nomination.",

    "1928 United States presidential election in Illinois": "Republican candidate Herbert Hoover won the state of Illinois in the 1928 United States presidential election, and would emerge victorious from the overall election. State voters chose 29 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nA strongly Democratic state during the Second Party System, Illinois became Republican-leaning after the American Civil War due to a combination of strong Free Soil Party heritage amongst its Yankee northern counties with the wartime conversion of some Virginian-settled rock-ribbed Democratic Southern Illinois counties to Unionist Republicanism à la Appalachia. Between the Civil War and World War I, partisanship in Illinois – like in the Border States – largely re-fought the war, with the result that although the Democratic Party gained at least 43 percent of the statewide vote via Southern and German Catholic support in every election up to 1900, they never gained an absolute majority and carried the state's electoral votes only in 1892.\nDue to the Democratic Party's growing Populist and prohibitionist leanings, a decline in Democratic support after 1900 in its German Central Illinois strongholds transformed Illinois into a powerfully Republican state at all levels. Even Woodrow Wilson in 1912 when the GOP was mortally divided carried the state by only a very narrow margin, and in 1920 hostility to the League of Nations and the perceived anti-German bias of both outgoing President Wilson and new Democratic nominee and former Ohio Governor James M. Cox – the latter of whom had banned German-language instruction in Ohio schools – meant Harding carried Illinois by over 42 percentage points and the state was his sixth strongest in a national landslide. Thirteen German Catholic or southern-settled counties went Republican for the first time.\nIn 1924, Calvin Coolidge maintained Harding's dominance despite losing substantial German Catholic and Mississippi Valley industrial support to Progressive Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette, whose family would endorse Catholic New York City Democrat Al Smith after the patriarch died in 1925. Despite some predictions of upheaval during April Hoover was easily nominated as the Republican candidate. Smith was nominated as the Democratic candidate.",
    "1928 United States presidential election in Kentucky": "The 1928 United States presidential election in Kentucky took place on November 6, 1928, as part of the 1928 United States presidential election. Voters chose 13 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEver since the Civil War, Kentucky had been shaped politically by divisions created by that war between secessionist, Democratic counties and Unionist, Republican ones, although the state as a whole leaned Democratic throughout this era and the GOP carried the state only in 1896 and 1924.\nIn 1928, as in all of the upland South, Kentucky's extremely stable Civil War partisan political pattern would become significantly disturbed due to the nomination, after all other prominent Democrats sat the election out due to the prevailing prosperity, of urban, anti-Prohibition Catholic Al Smith. Once Smith was nominated – despite his attempt to dispel fears by nominating \"dry\" Southern Democrat Joseph T. Robinson as his running mate – extreme fear ensued in the South, which had no experience of the Southern and Eastern European Catholic immigrants who were Smith's local constituency. Southern fundamentalist Protestants believed that Smith would allow papal and priestly leadership in the United States, which Protestantism was a reaction against. In the east of the state where many communities were becoming sundown towns or counties it was believed that Smith was unacceptable also because the Catholic Church officially opposed social and political segregation of the races.\nAs with the former Confederate states, opposition to Smith in Kentucky was organised by the Protestant churches, led by James Cannon Jr. and Arthur J.

Voters chose ten representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEver since the passage of a new constitution in 1898, Louisiana had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. The Republican Party became moribund due to the disenfranchisement of Black voters and the complete absence of other support bases, as Louisiana lacked upland or German refugee whites opposed to secession. Despite this single-party dominance, non-partisan tendencies remained strong among wealthy sugar planters in Acadiana and within the business elite of New Orleans.\nFollowing disfranchisement, the state’s politics became dominated by a coalition of the New Orleans-based Choctaw Club of Louisiana and Black Belt planters. Opposition began to emerge with the Socialist Party in the lumbering parishes of the northern hills and Imperial Calcasieu in the late 1900s, and more seriously with the Progressive movement, chiefly in the southern sugar-growing parishes, in the 1910s. Conflicts with President Wilson’s Underwoood-Simmons Act allowed Progressive Whitmell P. Martin to be elected to the Third Congressional District in 1914, and in 1920 the racially less hardline Acadiana region turned to Republican candidate Warren G. Harding over disagreements on foreign policy and the Nineteenth Amendment. Continued opposition to the Choctaw Club would elect former Progressive John M. Parker as governor at the beginning of 1920; however, Parker did not deliver his promised reforms, and Choctaw control returned temporarily with the 1924 election of Henry L. Fuqua.\nLouisiana’s delegates to the Democratic National Convention largely backed Catholic New York Governor Al Smith, who was opposed in the remainder of the South for his religion and opposition to Prohibition.",

Hoover won all eight of the state's electoral votes as a result. Despite Hoover's landslide win, Maryland voted 2.68% more Democratic than the nation at-large. Hoover became the first ever Republican victor in Wicomico and Worcester counties. Maryland would not vote Republican again until 1948.",
    "1928 United States presidential election in Mississippi": "The 1928 United States presidential election in Mississippi took place on November 6, 1928, as part of the wider United States presidential election. Voters chose 10 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMississippi voted for the Democratic nominee, Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York, over the Republican nominee, former Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California. Smith ran with Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson of Arkansas, while Hoover's running mate was Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis of Kansas.\nSmith won Mississippi by a margin of 64.20%. It was his second strongest state, after South Carolina.\nThis was the first election since 1888 that a Republican won any county in Mississippi, and the first time since 1892 where a county in the state would vote for a candidate who was not a Democrat. Pearl River, Stone County, George County voted Republican for the first time since their creation.",

    "1928 United States presidential election in Oklahoma": "The 1928 United States presidential election in Oklahoma took place on November 6, 1928, as part of the 1928 United States presidential election which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states. Voters chose ten representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. \nIn its early years, Oklahoma was a “Solid South” state whose founding fathers like \"Alfalfa Bill\" Murray and Charles N. Haskell had disfranchised most of its black population via literacy tests and grandfather clauses, the latter of which would be declared unconstitutional in Guinn v. United States. In 1920 this “Solid South” state, nonetheless, joined the Republican landslide of Warren G. Harding, electing a GOP senator and five congressmen, but in 1922 the Democratic Party returned to their typical ascendancy as the state GOP became bitterly divided.\nIn this Ku Klux Klan-dominated state almost entirely part of the Southern Protestant “Bible Belt”, the nomination of anti-Prohibition Catholic New York Governor Al Smith as the Democratic nominee was extremely controversial, with prominent former Senator Robert Latham Owen refusing steadfastly to endorse him, despite nominating dry Southern Democrat Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson of Arkansas.\nEarly polls showed a massive trend away from Smith, with a September poll saying seventy-six thousand Oklahoma Democrats would vote for Republican nominees, former Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California and Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis of Kansas, and a mid-October poll saying Hoover would receive seventy percent of the vote in Oklahoma. At the end of October, although the number of Oklahoma Democrats believed to be supporting Hoover had not fallen, and a finding that the Republicans had helped enroll one hundred and fifty thousand new voters, Hoover’s margin was reduced to fifty thousand.\nAs it turned out, the later poll was over-favourable to Smith. Hoover ultimately won the state by a margin of 28.28 percentage points.",
    "1928 United States presidential election in Tennessee": "The 1928 United States presidential election in Tennessee took place on November 6, 1928, as part of the 1928 United States presidential election. Tennessee voters chose 12 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nFor over a century after the Civil War, Tennessee was divided according to political loyalties established in that war. Unionist regions covering almost all of East Tennessee, Kentucky Pennyroyal-allied Macon County, and the five West Tennessee Highland Rim counties of Carroll, Henderson, McNairy, Hardin and Wayne voted Republican – generally by landslide margins – as they saw the Democratic Party as the \"war party\" who had forced them into a war they did not wish to fight. Contrariwise, the rest of Middle and West Tennessee who had supported and driven the state's secession was equally fiercely Democratic as it associated the Republicans with Reconstruction. After the disfranchisement of the state's African-American population by a poll tax was largely complete in the 1890s, the Democratic Party was certain of winning statewide elections if united, although unlike the Deep South Republicans would almost always gain thirty to forty percent of the statewide vote from mountain and Highland Rim support. When the Democratic Party was bitterly divided, the Republicans did win the governorship in 1910 and 1912, but did not gain at other levels.\nThe 1920 election saw a significant but not radical change, whereby by moving into a small number of traditionally Democratic areas in Middle Tennessee and expanding turnout due to the Nineteenth Amendment and powerful isolationist sentiment, the Republican Party was able to capture Tennessee's presidential electoral votes and win the governorship and take three congressional seats in addition to the rock-ribbed GOP First and Second Districts. In 1922 and 1924, with the ebbing of isolationist sympathy and a consequent decline in turnout, the Democratic Party regained Tennessee's governorship and presidential electoral votes.\nEarly in the campaign, Tennessee was seen as a \"puzzle\" for political pundits, and the state was viewed as \"doubtful\".",

The decision to employ a professional football trainer/manager was made because FC Basel had slipped well below the level of their local rivals Nordstern, who had qualified for the finals three times in the last five years.\nBasel played a total of 29 matches in their 1928–29 season. 16 of these were in the domestic league, three were in the Swiss Cup and 10 were friendly matches.

    "1928–29 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season": "The 1928–29 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 31st season of play for the program.\n\n\n== Season ==\nBefore the season began a major change had to be undertaken; the Boston Madison Square Garden, the new indoor facility for the Boston Bruins, was going to serve as the new home for Harvard hockey, but due to a lack of ice, the team would have to travel south to use the New York Madison Square Garden for practices. Tex Rickard controlled both buildings and he was willing to let Harvard have access to either. There was also a change of university policy for the team as it was now able to play more than two away games per season.\nThe team opened their season with a pair of solid wins and then lost their two-game series against Toronto. Despite the loss, Harvard had pushed the Blues into overtime in both games and looked to be as strong as they were the year before. The second game only ended in a scoreless tie due to Toronto's captain throwing his stick to knock the puck off of a Crimson stick (not a penalty at the time). Harvard's championship hopes were dealt a serious blow when they lost the first game of their collegiate season on Dartmouth's new rink and then had to wait over a month before their next game.\nThe Crimson were able to exact some revenge in the rematch against the Indians but they had little margin for error after an easy tilt against Pennsylvania. They entered the series against Yale with their foes having gone undefeated to that point (13–0–1) but Harvard could still spoil the Eli's season.",

    "1931 Chicago housing protests": "The Housing Protests on the South Side of Chicago in August 1931 began as a clash between white police and African Americans over the eviction of Diana Gross, a seventy-two year old black woman. Police were sent to enforce the eviction and encountered direct conflict with the crowd that had assembled and who were attempting to place her furniture back inside her home. The ensuing confrontation between police and the protesters led to the shooting deaths of two black men during the event, one black man killed later in the aftermath, as well as several injuries to policemen.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== 1930s Economics ===\nThe 1930s were a desperate time in the American economy as the Great Depression began to take its toll across the nation. People that were poor or unskilled, immigrants, as well as blacks suffered these effects more than their white counterparts. Rosenzweig argues that these unemployed did not simply \"accept their lot\" but instead developed strategies for survival such as \"formal and informal cooperative movements, family and neighborhood networks of assistance, individual and group looting of supermarkets, coal bootlegging, determined searches for work, and innovative stretching of income.\" During the first two summers after the start of the Great Depression, evictions in large urban cities were not uncommon. These numerous evictions were addressed in Chicago in a \"specialized branch of the municipal court, the so-called 'Renter's Court'\" By 1931 the non-payment of rent in Chicago had become such a problem that landlords were, while pursuing and threatening evictions, willing to take any help from the courts that would provide them even a partial months rent. It was here that the Communist Party (CP) chose to interject itself as an active participant in the turmoil of the  Chicago South Side.\n\n\n=== American Communist Party and Unemployment Councils ===\nThe Communist Party faced its own Depression Era problems that left them struggling to remain viable after World War I and the first \"Red Scare.\" In 1929 while most Americans were celebrating Republican prosperity, the Communist Party was in Cleveland organizing a new labor group called the Trade Union Unity League (TUUL) which had as one objective, the setting up of \"Councils of Unemployed Workers.\" Rosenzweig notes that organizational attempts in Chicago were very \"visible.\" In Chicago there were 2088 demonstrations by 1934 along with leafleting, eviction protests, and personal contracts which were intended to rebuild the CP's Chicago base. This Communist unemployed movement continued to grow because of the destitute situation that many working poor found themselves in and because of the inability of local relief groups to adequately provide enough support.",

    "1932 Cedar Mountain earthquake": "The Cedar Mountain earthquake of 1932 was one of the largest seismic events in the US state of Nevada. The Ms 7.3 earthquake struck at Cedar Mountain in Western Nevada. Shaking was felt as far as Oregon, Southern California, and the Rocky Mountains area. Nevada is the third most seismically active state in the United States due to ongoing rifting occurring within the North American Plate. Extension or thinning of the crust has resulted in numerous faults accommodating strain, at the same time, producing earthquakes. Since the earthquake occurred in a remote part of the state, damage was limited and no deaths were reported.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nWestern Nevada lies along the edge of the geologic province known as the Basin and Range. This area of rifting within the North American continent does so in a northwest-southeast direction. Extension of the crust has resulted in a diffuse area of low slip rate faults. This network of predominantly strike-slip and normal faults termed the Central Nevada Seismic Belt (CNSB) occasionally undergoes large \"beltlike\" earthquake sequences to help accommodate regional stresses with multiple sequences having occurred in the past 13,000 years.",
    "1932 Christchurch tramway strike": "The 1932 Christchurch tramway strike was an industrial dispute between tramway workers and their employers that took place in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand during the Great Depression. It lasted 16 days and led to the injury and arrest of many local people on both sides of the dispute.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nDuring the Great Depression the Christchurch Tramway Board faced financial problems from falling revenue. In 1931 the Tramway Board attempted to cut salaries and working conditions, exploiting a legal loophole in the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Tramway Workers' Union rejected the proposed changes and as a result the board dismissed the entire traffic staff and opened applications for replacement positions under the new conditions. To settle the dispute an independent mediator was brought in and largely found in the union's favour. Nonetheless, an atmosphere of mistrust between the board and workers manifested.\nIn early 1932 the board proposed to rationing work hours for a period of two months to prevent redundancies, to which the union grudgingly agreed. When the period ended the board sought to extend the arrangement the union refused. The board responded by dismissing 12 employees (including the union president John Mathison) as a way to reduce costs.",

    "1936 Catalan coup attempt": "The Catalan coup d'etat was an unsuccessful takeover of power in autonomous Catalonia, planned by the independentist party Estat Català. The conspirators intended to declare the total independence of Catalonia as a state neutral in the Spanish Civil War, and to marginalize all non-aligned political groupings, especially the Anarchists. They counted on party militias and Catalan army and security units, infiltrated by the Estat Català militants. The coup was planned in November, as the plotters assumed that the central Republican government, absorbed by the battle of Madrid, would not be able to take action. The plot failed because of the Anarchist counter-action, which exposed the scheme and some of its leaders. In pre-emptive strike Generalitat services detained a few of the conspirators; the others fled to France. Estat Català was sidelined, while CNT-FAI ensured its dominant position in Catalonia. The attempted coup remains a poorly researched and rather unknown episode; in historiography it is discussed against the background of Catalan fascism.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince the late 19th century along traditional political groupings – Conservatives, Liberals, Carlists, Republicans – there were new currents emerging in Catalonia: Socialists, Communists, Anarchists and Catalan nationalists.

Fought between the republican and nationalist forces between September and October 1936. The nationalists initially took control of Fernando Po on 19 September, later seizing control of the rest of the colony after receiving reinforcements in October.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Spanish Empire established the colony of Spanish Guinea in 1778, in the aftermath of the Treaty of El Pardo, between the former and the Kingdom of Portugal. Portuguese slave traders retained the de facto control of the region until Carlos Chacón was declared its first governor general in 1858. During the course of the Scramble for Africa, Spain lost significant portions of its territories in the Gulf of Guinea to France and Germany. Its disastrous defeat in the Spanish–American War of 1898, further reduced its colonial possessions, while simultaneously increasing Spanish Guinea's importance as an overseas territory. Exploitation of the colony's natural resources began in earnest, missionaries set up permanent outposts across its territory and the Colonial Guard of Spanish Guinea was formed in 1908 to protect its new settlers.\nFollowing the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic, colonial policies shifted towards increasing Guinea's economic output. To that end, the government limited the influence of Claretian Catholic missionaries and legal rights of the native population.",

It resulted in 341 cases of typhoid (43 fatal), and it caused considerable local discontent leading to a media campaign and a public inquiry.\nThe source of the illness remained a mystery until the cases were mapped out using epidemiological method. The origin was found to be the polluted chalk water well at Addington, London, which supplied water to up to one-fifth of the area that is now the London Borough of Croydon. Coupled with issues around the co-operation between the medical officers and the administrators of the Borough, three coincidental events were blamed; changes to the well structure by repair work, the employment of a new workman who was an unwitting carrier of typhoid, and failure to chlorinate the water.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Public Health Act 1848 (11 & 12 Vict. c. 63) gave local boards of health powers to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by supervising the cleaning of streets, collection of refuse, disposal of sewage and supplying clean water. Subsequently, an integrated water supply and sewage disposal system was installed at Croydon, twelve miles south of London, one of the first towns to have one, when its population was around 20,000. Although the system was supposedly a sanitary pioneer, the death rate in the town rose after installation and typhoid outbreaks occurred in 1853 and 1875, possibly as a result of the new system permitting the disease to spread more efficiently.",

    "1938 San Antonio pecan shellers strike": "The 1938 San Antonio pecan shellers strike was a labor strike involving 12,000 pecan shellers in San Antonio, Texas, United States. Considered the largest labor strike in San Antonio's history, it saw mainly Mexican American pecan shellers, organized by labor activist Emma Tenayuca, protest wage cuts by the Southern Pecan Shelling Company. Starting on January 31, the strike lasted until March 8, when the two sides agreed to arbitration that led to a wage increase for the pecan shellers.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the 1930s, 40% of the pecan crop in the United States was grown in Texas, with half of that being produced within a 250 mile radius of San Antonio. Described as the \"world's largest pecan shelling center\", between 10,000 to 20,000 workers, primarily Mexican American women, worked as shellers, removing the hard outer shell of pecans grown and collected in the region. Many of them worked in poor conditions for low pay. The average weekly family income for pecan shellers was between $1.00 and $4.00, with many shellers having to supplement their seasonal income with additional farm labor. Additionally, the workrooms were often cramped centers often lacking proper ventilation, running water, and tools for shelling, with many of the shellers having to use their hands to shell the pecans. An increased rate of tuberculosis among the shellers was also pinned on the lack of proper ventilation and an abundance of pecan particulates in the workrooms. \nIn the 1930s, the Southern Pecan Shelling Company, owned by Julius Seligman, dominated the pecan shelling industry both in San Antonio and nationwide, shelling between one-fourth and one-third of the total national output of pecans.",

    "1938 deportation of Jews from Slovakia": "From 4 to 7 November 1938, thousands of Jews were deported from Slovakia to the no-man's land on the Slovak−Hungarian border. Following Hungarian territorial gains in the First Vienna Award on 2 November, Slovak Jews were accused of favoring Hungary in the dispute. With the help of Adolf Eichmann, Slovak People's Party leaders planned the deportation, which was carried out by local police and the Hlinka Guard. Conflicting orders were issued to target either Jews who were poor or those who lacked Slovak citizenship, resulting in chaos.\nMany of the deportees managed to return home within a few days, but more than 800 were left in tent camps near Miloslavov, Veľký Kýr, and Šamorín in the no man's land along the border for months with some groups staying until January or February 1939. Another several hundred Jews were deported from Hungary to the no man's land. In the meantime they endured winter weather with little or no shelter, although they were helped by Jewish organizations in Bratislava. The deportations were a fiasco for the Slovak People's Party leadership, worsening the country's reputation abroad and causing capital flight by frightened Jews who intended to emigrate, but they were a preparation for the 1942 deportations to the ghettos and extermination camps in German-occupied Poland.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement, in which the Czechoslovak Sudetenland was annexed by Nazi Germany, the Slovak People's Party (HSĽS)—long in favor of Slovak autonomy or independence—unilaterally announced Slovakia's autonomy within the Second Czechoslovak Republic. HSĽS was an ethnonationalist party which had a paramilitary wing, the Hlinka Guard.",

The miners proved unable to meet management production quotas and the mine owners refused to pay the previously agreed minimum daily wage, alleging deliberate slow working. An arbitrator called in to review the dispute ruled that the quotas were achievable. The miners disagreed and went on strike from 9 January.\nUnder wartime regulations, Order 1305, striking was illegal unless the matter had been referred to the Ministry of Labour and National Service for settlement.

All of the seven crew were killed.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 29 August 1944, at 2110 English time (2210 Danish time), a total of 402 RAF planes, including the Lancaster in question, took off for a bombing raid towards Stettin and Königsberg. The planned route passed over northern Denmark, then continued over Sweden and Germany; it returned the same way. 23 of the aircraft were ultimately lost.\nIt was previously thought that the downed bomber was first hit on its return flight by anti-aircraft artillery at Lyngby Battery, located on the coast ~10 km south of Vorupør, Thy. However, later investigation showed that the bomber was instead first hit on its outbound flight by shots fired from a radar-equipped German night fighter over Lodbjerg (slightly further south on the Danish west coast). The bomber was executing a course change from north east to east by south-east at the time, in order to proceed to the Kullen region of Scania. The night fighter was probably scrambled following the bomber being detected by several German radar installations in Denmark. A small Wassermann-S radar at Thyborøn (on the coast south of Ålvand) pinged the Lancaster on the night of the crash, as did an installation at Hjardemål (inland, to the north-east).",

Greece was liberated, so the HFF made the decision to start the regional championships again. The Athenian championship started with the participation of 8 teams, but was not completed because of disputes between Panathinaikos and the Athenian Association over the illegal usage of one of the footballers of Panionios, Giannakakos, in April 1945. As a result, Panathinaikos was expelled from the championship and had a 15-day ban from any sports activity, according to the decision made by the Athenian Association and HFF. Panathinaikos was not keen on the decision, so he refused to participate in any official competition of that season. The championship started with a big delay, in October 1945 and ended in mid-December, when it was abandoned.\nDespite the non-conduction of the Panhellenic Championship, a tournament called \"Freedom Cup\" was held in April 1945 with a format of 2 groups of a total of 14 teams from Athens and Piraeus. Eventually, the tournament failed to finish as well in July 1945, because the finals of both groups were not able to be completed for various reasons, so the titles were not awarded, as provided in the announcement of the tournament. The point system was: Win: 3 points - Draw: 2 points - Loss: 1 point.\n\n\n== Qualification round ==\n\n\n=== Athens Football Clubs Association ===\n\nPanathinaikos refused to participate in the championship due to previous disputes with the Athenian Association. 5 other teams joined with them: Apollon Athens, Atromitos, Athinaikos, Asteras Athens and Arion Kolonaki.",

    "1946 Soviet occupation zone state elections": "State elections were held in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany on 20 October 1946 to elect the state legislatures of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. They were the only elections held in the future territory of East Germany before the establishment of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, and the only free and fair elections in that part of Germany between 1932 and the Peaceful Revolution.\nThe Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), which was formed by the forced merger of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in the Soviet occupation zone, became the largest party but achieved an absolute majority in only one state. The SED was created in view of the holding of elections in the Soviet zone, as a first step for future political reforms. \nIn addition to the SED, three other parties participated; the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Peasants Mutual Aid Association (VdgB). Two other organizations participated but only in Saxony. The SED landslide victory was seen by Soviet authorities as a justification for the development of socialism in their zone. The occupation authorities quickly dropped all pretense of liberal democracy, and cajoled the other parties into forming a \"coalition\" in which only the SED had any real power. By the time of the elections for a constitutional assembly in 1949, voters only had the option of approving or rejecting a \"unity list\" put forward by the SED-dominated Democratic Bloc.\nThe next state elections were held in 1950, after the establishment of the German Democratic Republic.",

    "1946 United Nations Secretary-General selection": "The United Nations Secretary-General selection of 1946 took place at the opening session of the United Nations in London.  The General Assembly first voted on the membership of the Security Council, which then selected the first Secretary-General of the United Nations.  The United States and the United Kingdom supported Lester B. Pearson of Canada for Secretary-General, but the Soviet Union opposed Pearson since the permanent headquarters of the United Nations would be in North America.

During WWII, the US Air Force set up operations at Chongqing, including the Flying Tigers units that fought Japanese forces in China. The US military remained in Chongqing after the end of the war, and US government agents were instrumental in organizing negotiations between the Kuomintang and CCP.

    "1947 Cook Islands Legislative Council election": "Legislative Council elections were held in the Cook Islands in 1947, the first after the establishment of the new legislature.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Cook Islands Legislative Council was formed following legislation passed in October 1946, and consisted of ten members indirectly elected by island councils (four from Rarotonga and six from smaller islands), ten civil servants appointed by the Governor-General of New Zealand and the Resident Commissioner, who was president of the council. The island councils were made partially elective, and the elected members of the councils were eligible to be candidates for election to the Legislative Council. It was intended that the elected European member of Rarotonga Island Council would automatically become the European member of the Legislative Council. However, the legislation published required the European member to be elected by indigenous members of the Island Council.\nThe island council elections took place in March. In Rarotonga there was a contested election for the European seat (which Europeans living anywhere in the Cook Islands could vote for) for the first time in several years; incumbent member Willie Watson defeated Stuart Kingan by 47 votes to 37, with all but two registered voters casting ballots.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe elected members included one woman, Tararo Jane Ariki, ariki of Mauke island.\n\nThe official members included the Acting Resident Agent of Aitutaki, the Chief Medical Officer, the Director of Agriculture, the Education Officer, the Resident Agents of Atiu, Mangaia, Mauke, Penrhyn and Rakahanga, and the Treasurer.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe newly elected Council met for the first time on 5 November 1947.",

His margin of victory of 572,067 votes was, at the time, record-breaking for an Illinois gubernatorial election.\nStevenson's strong performance in the gubernatorial election and Democratic nominee Paul Douglas' strong performance in the 1948 United States Senate election in Illinois were regarded as having helped the Democratic ticket of Harry S. Truman and Alben W. Barkley secure their narrow victory in Illinois in the 1948 United States presidential election.\n\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n\n=== Campaign ===\nAdlai Stevenson II was chosen by Jacob Arvey, leader of the powerful Cook County Democratic Party organization, to the Democratic candidate in the Illinois gubernatorial race against the incumbent Republican governor, Dwight H. Green. While Stevenson had a preference for a role that would see him involved in national politics, such as being a United States senator, the path for him to run for senate would have been difficult, while Arvey was offering him a clear path to be elected governor.",

At the time, Nauru was dominated by Australia as a United Nations trust territory, with New Zealand and the UK as co-trustees.  \n\n\n== Background ==\n\nChinese labourers were first brought to Nauru in 1907 by the Pacific Phosphate Company, at which time the island was a German protectorate. They became the preferred source of labour for the phosphate mines, as they were regarded as better workers than the Nauruans, were willing to sign three-year contracts, and, unlike Pacific Islanders, were willing to live on the island for the duration of their employment. The Nauruan and Chinese communities had little contact, and their separation was encouraged by the company and the German administration. The Chinese were blamed for a series of disease epidemics which saw the Nauruan population reduced from 1,550 in 1905 to 1,250 in 1910. By 1914, there were 1,000 immigrant workers on Nauru, half of which were Chinese and the other half Caroline Islanders.\nDuring World War I, Nauru was occupied by Australian forces and subsequently became a League of Nations mandate. Phosphate mining was taken over by the British Phosphate Commission (BPC), a joint venture of Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. The BPC discontinued the recruitment of Caroline Islanders, as the islands had come under Japanese control, and attempted to replace them with workers from Australia's other mandate, the Territory of New Guinea. However, the experiment proved unsuccessful and by 1924 the Chinese were the only remaining foreign labourers.",

    "1950 United Nations Secretary-General selection": "The United Nations Secretary-General selection of 1950 took place as the Cold War turned hot in the Korean War.  The Soviet Union vetoed Trygvie Lie's second term and offered to vote for any other candidate.  However, the United States insisted that Lie had to continue in office as Secretary-General, pressuring its allies to abstain on all other candidates.  When a Latin American candidate appeared to have enough votes to win, the United States threatened to use its veto for the first time.  After a second round of voting with no candidates receiving the required majority, the Security Council informed the General Assembly that it had been unable to agree on a recommendation.  The General Assembly then extended Lie's term for three years.\nThe 1950 selection is the only time that the General Assembly voted on the office of Secretary-General despite a veto in the Security Council.  The Soviet Union considered the vote to be illegal and treated the office of Secretary-General as vacant upon the expiration of Lie's original term.  The veto has been respected in all future selections.  In the 1996 selection, the United States found itself on the losing side of a 14-1-0 vote recommending Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term.",

An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November. Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45°E and 100°E are included in the season by the IMD.\nLike in the previous season, most of the storms formed in the season are weak, as four of the fifteen tropical depressions formed intensified to become tropical cyclones.

Firefighters and four ambulances reached the crash scene after following the rising smoke plume but it was quickly discovered that all 44 onboard had perished in the flaming wreckage.\n\n\n== Probable cause ==\nThe cause of the crash was determined to possibly be a heavy deposit of lead on the spark plugs in the engines. The investigation states that as the plugs warmed up during takeoff, the metal deposits formed a circuit which ended up short circuiting the plugs causing the fatal engine failure and subsequent stalling and crash of the aircraft.",
    "1953 Sarnia tornado outbreak": "A localized but devastating series of severe thunderstorms affected the Great Lakes region during May 20-21, 1953. The strongest of these storms produced three intense, long-tacked tornadoes in Iowa, Michigan, and Ontario. The worst tornado event was a violent F4 tornado that tore through the cities of Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario, on May 21, damaging or destroying hundreds of structures and causing dozens of casualties. Overall, the tornadoes killed eight people, injured 123 others, and caused at least $17.6 million (1953 USD) in damage. Thunderstorm winds also caused an additional fatality when a tree fell on a house in Waterloo, Iowa.\n\n\n== Meteorological synopsis ==\nA low pressure system formed over south central Montana early on May 20, 1953. This low moved eastward into South Dakota as favorable conditions to its east generated scattered severe thunderstorms across the Upper Midwest thanks in part to another low that was moving northeastward through Ontario. Continuing eastward, the original low moved into Minnesota by May 21 as it made a gradual northeastward turn, producing more severe weather across Ohio and Michigan until a high-pressure system pushed out of the area.\n\n\n== Confirmed tornadoes ==\n\nAccording to Thomas P. Grazulis, an F2 tornado destroyed or damaged a motel and several barns as it affected six farms near Chelsea and Blairstown, Iowa before causing severe damage in Fairfax, on May 20. The tornado reportedly struck Tama and Benton counties in Iowa.",

    "1954 Rainbow Mountain-Fairview Peak-Dixie Valley earthquakes": "In 1954, the state of Nevada was struck by a series of earthquakes that began with three magnitude 6.0+ events in July and August that preceded the Mw  7.1–7.3 mainshock and M 6.9 aftershock, both on December 12. All five earthquakes are among the largest in the state, and the largest since the Cedar Mountain earthquake (M 7.2) of 1932 and Pleasant Valley event (Ms  7.7) in 1915. The earthquake was felt throughout much of the western United States.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe state of Nevada sits within a geologic province known as the Basin and Range. The Basin and Range Province is bounded by the Colorado Plateau, Wasatch Fault, Rio Grande Rift and Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. This region in the North American continent is rifting apart in a northwest–southeast direction. Extension of the crust has resulted in a basin and range topography, dominated by dip-slip (normal) faults accommodating extension. Fault block tilting has created many mountain ranges no more than 16 km wide and 130 km long. The movement of the Sierra Nevada Microplate to the northwest compared to the North American Plate's movement southwest creates a zone of N-S trending distributed faulting in central Nevada known as the Central Nevada Seismic Belt (CNSB). The CNSB is a network of low slip rate faults that have been active since at least the late Quaternary.",

The preamble of the agreement stated the panchsheel, or  the five principles of peaceful coexistence, that China proposed and India favoured. The agreement reflected the adjustment of the previously existing trade relations between Tibet and India to the changed context of India's decolonisation and China's assertion of suzerainty over Tibet. Bertil Lintner writes that in the agreement, \"Tibet was referred to, for the first time in history, as 'the Tibet Region of China'\".\nThe agreement expired on 6 June 1962, as per the original term limit, in the midst of the Sino-Indian border tensions. It was not renewed. By October of that year, war broke out between the two sides.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe background of the 1954 Agreement includes the Convention of Calcutta (between Britain and China, concerning Tibet), the Convention of Lhasa (between Britain and Tibet), the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet, the Anglo-Russian Convention, Anglo Chinese trade regulations of 1908 and 1914, the alteration of the Aitchison treaty in 1938, the failure of the Tibetan appeal to the UN, the Seven Point Agreement 1951 (between China and the Ganden Phodrang government of Tibet), the Sino-India negotiations concerning Tibet, 1951 to 1953, and the Sino–India conference on Tibetan trade and intercourse, December 1953 to April 1954.\n\n\n=== Negotiations regarding inclusion of passes ===\nIn December 1953, the Sino–India conference on Tibetan trade and intercourse started.

The race was won by Tony Brooks, in his first Formula One race, driving a Connaught type B. This was the first international Grand Prix win for a British car since the 1924 San Sebastián Grand Prix.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter two fairly poor seasons, Connaught were close to running out of money, and were considering withdrawing from racing altogether. However they received an invitation to the Syracuse Grand Prix which included an offer of substantial starting money, so decided they would enter. They did not, however, have enough money to afford them an experienced driver. Instead they looked to dental student Tony Brooks, who had had some success in Aston Martin and Connaught sports cars earlier in the year but had never even driven a Formula One car before, as well as Formula Three driver Les Leston.\nAlthough Ferrari did not enter, Maserati entered a full team of five cars, to the relief of the race organisers. Few expected the Maserati team to have any trouble against the Connaughts, Gordinis, several privately entered Maseratis and two privately entered Ferraris.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Practice/Qualifying ===\nThe first practice session was on Friday afternoon.

    "1957 Bank Rate Tribunal": "The Bank Rate Tribunal was a 1957 United Kingdom tribunal established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 to inquire into the allegations that an increase in Official Bank Rate had been improperly discussed ahead of its public announcement by the Bank of England. Rumours and allegations had circulated that some financiers had taken advantage of their advance knowledge of a planned Bank rate rise, and so the inquiry primarily sought to establish whether there had been a form of insider trading.\nThe Tribunal took evidence in the winter of 1957, under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Parker, with Milner Holland CBE QC and Geoffrey de Paiva Veale QC. It reported on 21 January 1958. It ultimately concluded that there was \"no justification for allegations that information about the raising of the Bank Rate was improperly disclosed to any person\". The inquiry attracted some attention in the winter of 1957 as details of the interactions amongst financiers - and between bankers, Bank of England officials, and government figures - became public, shining some light on how the City of London operated. The Report particularly attracted attention through a two-day debate in the House of Commons in February 1958, and the press reaction to the Report was \"distinctly critical\", with suggestions that the Report was a whitewash.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Bank Rate had been increased in September 1957, but rumours rapidly circulated around the City of London that some financiers - who simultaneously held positions within the Bank of England and within private financial companies - took advantage of advance warning of the rate rise to sell gilt-edged securities ahead of the public announcement. The rumours gained credibility when the diplomat Laurence Pumphrey reported a conversation concerning a possible leak of the proposed rate rise; his cousin, who worked as a secretary in Conservative Central Office, told him that the proposed rate rise was common knowledge in her office before the public announcement. In order to ensure that the matter was properly investigated, he reported the conversation to the Labour Opposition rather than to his superiors at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\nThe Shadow Chancellor Harold Wilson pushed hard for an independent inquiry, but the prime minister Harold Macmillan was adamant than an inquiry be led by his Cabinet colleague the Lord Chancellor Viscount Kilmuir.",
