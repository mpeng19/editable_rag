      "Model Answer:  The 1880 Indiana gubernatorial election resulted in a Republican victory, with Albert G. Porter defeating Franklin Landers. This outcome had a significant impact on the political landscape of Indiana and the nation as a whole. It marked a shift in power from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party, which had been gaining strength in the state and nation since the Civil War. The election also solidified the Republican Party's position as a dominant force in Indiana politics, a position it would maintain for much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Additionally, the election of Albert G. Porter, a prominent businessman and politician, helped to establish the Republican Party's reputation as a champion of business interests and fiscal conservatism. Overall, the 1880 Indiana gubernatorial election was a significant turning point in the political history of Indiana and the United States.\n",

      "Model Answer:  The governor and lieutenant governor could have been from different parties during the recall, but this would not have had any significant impact on the process. The recall election would have still been held, and the winner would have become the new governor, regardless of their party affiliation. The lieutenant governor would have continued to serve as the acting governor until the recall election was held and the new governor was sworn in. In the case of a tie in the recall election, the lieutenant governor would have continued to serve as the acting governor until a special election was held to break the tie.\n",

      "Model Answer:  The lieutenant governor has the power to serve as acting governor when the governor is unable to fulfill their duties, such as when they resign, die, or are removed from office. The lieutenant governor's powers as acting governor vary depending on the state's constitution and laws, but they typically have the authority to sign or veto legislation, appoint officials, and make executive decisions for the state. However, the lieutenant governor's powers are limited to the extent that they are not elected as governor in their own right and may not have the same level of authority or legitimacy as an elected governor.\n",
